The crossing time for a group is determined by the slowest member of the group.\n\nTo get all four people across in exactly 10 minutes, the most efficient way is for all four to cross together. Here's the step-by-step sequence:\n\n1. A (1 minute), B (3 minutes), C (5 minutes), and D (10 minutes) all cross the bridge together. Since D is the slowest, the crossing takes 10 minutes.\n\nAfter this single crossing, all four are on the other side with the torch, and the total time is 10 minutes, which meets the requirement of \"no more than 10 minutes.\"\n\nThis approach minimizes the time because D must cross at any crossing involving any crossing involving D will take at least 10 minutes due to D's slow pace. By having all cross together, no additional time is spent on return trips or multiple crossings, making 10 minutes the minimum possible time.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{A, B, C, and D all cross the bridge together in 10 minutes.}}",

If the common difference \\(d\\) is positive, the sequence is increasing: 110, 132, 154, 176, 198, 220. The greatest is 220, which is double the least (110), and the sum is \\(3 \\times (110 + 220) = 3 \\times 330 = 990\\).
