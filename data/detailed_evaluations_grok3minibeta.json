You pick one, but before you can open it the host opens one of the others revealing a donkey. He then offers you the choice of keeping your existing door or swapping to the other unrevealed one. What should you do to win a car?",
        "original_response": "To maximize your chances of winning the car in this game show scenario (which is essentially the famous Monty Hall problem), you should **switch to the other unrevealed door**. Let me explain why, step by step, so it makes sense.\n\n### Why Switching is Better: A Probability Explanation\n- **Initial Choice**: When you first pick a door, you have a 1/3 chance of selecting the door with the car and a 2/3 chance of selecting a door with a donkey. This is because there are three doors, and only one has the car.\n  \n- **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what's behind all the doors, always opens a door that has a donkey. They never open your chosen door or the door with the car. This gives you new information, but it doesn't change the initial probabilities of your first choice.\n\n- **What Happens if You Stick vs. Switch**:\n  - If you **stick with your original door**, your probability of winning remains 1/3. You only win if your initial guess was correct, which is unlikely.\n  - If you **switch to the other unrevealed door**, your probability of winning increases to 2/3. Here's why:\n    - If your initial pick was the car (1/3 probability), switching will make you lose because the host reveals a donkey, and the other door also has a donkey.\n    - But if your initial pick was a donkey (2/3 probability), switching will make you win because the host reveals the other donkey, leaving the car behind the remaining door.\n\nSo, by switching, you're capitalizing on the fact that your first choice is more likely to be wrong (2/3 chance), and the host's action essentially \"gives away\" that information.\n\n### An Intuitive Way to Think About It\nImagine there were 100 doors instead of three, with one car and 99 donkeys. You pick one door (say, Door 1). The probability you picked the car is still just 1/100. Now, the host opens 98 other doors, all revealing donkeys, leaving one other door closed. Would you stick with your original choice or switch? Intuitively, switching makes more sense because your initial pick is probably wrong, and the host has essentially shown you where the donkeys are. The same logic applies to the three-door case, just with smaller numbers.\n\n### Final Advice\nAlways switch doors to give yourself a 2/3 chance of winning the car, compared to just 1/3 if you stick. It's counterintuitive at first, but the math checks out! If you're on the show, go for the switch\u2014good luck! \ud83d\ude97",
