The classic version of this puzzle has Person B taking 2 minutes (not 3), which would give us:\n3 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes\n\nWith B taking 3 minutes as stated, the minimum time appears to be 20 minutes using the strategy above.",

        "original_response": "Looking at this problem, let me break down what we know:\n\n- Initially there are 4 boxes, with 1 defective appliance among them\n- The clerk randomly opens and tests 1 box, which turns out to be good\n- This leaves 3 unopened boxes\n\nSince the clerk opened a box **randomly** and it happened to be good, we now have:\n- 3 remaining boxes\n- 1 of them contains the defective appliance\n- 2 of them contain good appliances\n\nBecause the clerk's selection was random, each of the 3 remaining boxes has an equal probability of being the defective one. Therefore:\n- Each remaining box has a 1/3 chance of being defective\n- Each remaining box has a 2/3 chance of being good\n\n**Answer: It doesn't matter which of the 3 remaining boxes the customer picks.** All three unopened boxes have the same probability (2/3) of containing a working appliance. The customer should simply pick whichever is most convenient to access or carry.",
