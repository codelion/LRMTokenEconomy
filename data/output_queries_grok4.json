They share one torch, which must be used for every crossing (forward or backward).

        "### Solution to the Bridge Crossing Puzzle\n\nThe four people\u2014A (1 min), B (2 min), C (5 min), and D (10 min)\u2014must all cross the bridge, which can hold at most two at a time. They share one torch, which must be used for every crossing (forward or backward). The time for any crossing is determined by the slower person's speed when two cross together. The total time must not exceed 17 minutes.\n\nHere is the optimal sequence to achieve this in exactly **17 minutes** (this is the minimum possible time):\n\n1. **A and B cross to the right** (takes 2 minutes, as B is slower).  \n   - Right side: A, B (with torch).  \n   - Left side: C, D.  \n   - Total time: 2 minutes.\n\n2. **A returns to the left with the torch** (takes 1 minute).  \n   - Right side: B.  \n   - Left side: A, C, D (with torch).  \n   - Total time: 3 minutes.\n\n3. **C and D cross to the right** (takes 10 minutes, as D is slower).  \n   - Right side: B, C, D (with torch).  \n   - Left side: A.  \n   - Total time: 13 minutes.\n\n4. **B returns to the left with the torch** (takes 2 minutes).  \n   - Right side: C, D.  \n   - Left side: A, B (with torch).  \n   - Total time: 15 minutes.\n\n5. **A and B cross to the right** (takes 2 minutes, as B is slower).  \n   - Right side: A, B, C, D (with torch).  \n   - Left side: (empty).  \n   - Total time: 17 minutes.\n\nAll four are now on the right side, and the torch is with them. This sequence ensures the slowest crossings (involving C and D) are minimized by pairing them together, while the fastest people (A and B) handle the torch returns to save time.\n\n#### Why This Works and Is Optimal\n- The key inefficiency is that the torch must be brought back after most crossings, costing extra time. \n- Pairing the two slowest (C and D) for a single 10-minute crossing avoids multiple slow trips.\n- Using A (fastest) for one return and B (second-fastest) for the other minimizes return times.\n- Alternative sequences (e.g., sending A with each slow person individually) result in 18+ minutes, exceeding the 17-minute limit.\n\nIf you try a different sequence and find a faster time, it's likely violating the rules (e.g., crossing without the torch or overloading the bridge)! This 17-minute solution is the standard and proven optimal."

        "Based on the setup you describe (which is a variation of the famous Monty Hall probability puzzle), you should **keep your existing door** to maximize your chance of winning a car. I'll explain why briefly below, including the math. If this doesn't match the exact intent of the puzzle or game show, please provide more details!\n\n### Quick Setup Recap\n- 3 doors: 2 luxury cars (good) + 1 donkey (bad).\n- You pick 1 door initially (without knowing what's behind it).\n- The host (who knows what's behind all doors) opens 1 of the remaining 2 doors to reveal a car.\n- You're offered the chance to stick with your door or switch to the other unopened door.\n- Goal: Win a car (i.e., avoid the donkey).\n\nThis is always possible for the host, since there's always at least one car among the two doors you didn't pick.\n\n### Why You Should Keep Your Door (Don't Switch)\n- Your initial pick has a **2/3 chance of being a car** (and a 1/3 chance of being the donkey), purely based on random odds.\n- The host's reveal of a car gives you new information, but in this inverted setup (where the \"reveal\" is a good prize rather than a bad one), it shifts the odds in a specific way.\n\nAfter the reveal:\n- If you **keep your door**, you have a **2/3 chance of winning a car**.\n- If you **switch doors**, you have only a **1/3 chance of winning a car** (and a 2/3 chance of getting the donkey).\n\nIn other words, switching hurts you here\u2014it's the opposite of the classic Monty Hall problem (where there are two bad prizes and one good prize, and you should switch).\n\n### Why the Math Works Out This Way\nLet's break it down with the possible scenarios (assume the doors are labeled A, B, and C for simplicity, and you initially picked Door A):\n\n1. **You initially picked the donkey** (1/3 odds).\n   - The other two doors (B and C) both have cars.\n   - Host reveals a car (say, from Door B). The remaining door (C) has the other car.\n   - If you switch to C, you get a car.\n   - If you keep A, you get the donkey.\n\n2. **You initially picked a car** (2/3 odds).\n   - One of the other doors has a car; the other has the donkey.\n   - Host must reveal the car (they won't reveal the donkey). So they open, say, Door B (the car), leaving Door C (the donkey).\n   - If you switch to C, you get the donkey.\n   - If you keep A, you get your car.\n\nCombining these:\n- **Switching**: You win a car only in scenario #1 (1/3 odds). You get the donkey in scenario #2 (2/3 odds).\n- **Keeping**: You win a car in scenario #2 (2/3 odds). You get the donkey in scenario #1 (1/3 odds).\n\nSticking with your door is always the better strategy here. It doesn't guarantee a win (nothing does), but it maximizes your odds at 2/3. Switching drops you to 1/3.\n\n### Other Notes\n- This assumes the host always reveals a car when possible (which they can) and doesn't have any bias in which door they pick if they have a choice.\n- If the host revealed the donkey instead of a car, it'd be a different puzzle (closer to the classic Monty Hall setup), and you'd want to switch.\n- This has been extensively studied and simulated in probability theory. You can even test it yourself with three cups and a friend acting as the host!\n\nIf you stick to this strategy over many games, you'll win a car ~66% of the time by not switching. Good luck on the game show!\n\nSources: This is a known variant of the Monty Hall problem, discussed in books like *The Monty Hall Problem* by Jason Rosenhouse and probability resources from MIT, Stanford, etc.",
        "You should keep your existing door (i.e., do not swap). This gives you a 2/3 chance of winning a car, which is better than the 1/3 chance if you swap.\n\nThis is a variation of the Monty Hall problem, and the probabilities are explained by Bayes' theorem (or by simply enumerating all equally likely possibilities, as I did during my reasoning). If the game is repeated many times under these exact rules, staying will win a car approximately twice as often as switching.  \nNo other factor (such as assumptions about the host's behavior) changes this.",
        "Based on the setup you describe (a variation on the classic Monty Hall problem), you should **keep your existing door** to maximize your chances of winning a car. Switching doors gives you worse odds.\n\n### Quick Explanation\n- You start with a 2/3 chance of having picked a car initially (and a 1/3 chance of having picked the donkey).\n- The host's reveal of a car doesn't change that.\n- If you stay with your original door, you keep that 2/3 chance of getting a car.\n- If you switch, your odds drop to 1/3.\n\nThis is effectively the Monty Hall problem with the number of \"good\" and \"bad\" prizes reversed, which flips the optimal strategy (in the classic version with two goats/one car, you'd switch). If the host's behavior or ability to reveal a car was any different than what you've described, it could change the odds, but there are no such indications in your question.\n\nIf this doesn't match the exact intent or setup of the question, feel free to provide more details for a refined answer!\n\n### References\n- Search for \"Monty Hall problem\" for hundreds of detailed explanations, simulations, and proofs (including variations like this one).\n- Wikipedia has a good \"Monty Hall Problem\" entry.\n- Marilyn vos Savant's famous column in *Parade* magazine.\n\n\\boxed{keep your existing door}",

        "To maximize your chances of winning the car, you should **swap to the other unrevealed door**. This is the famous Monty Hall problem, and I'll explain briefly below why this is the correct choice (including the math behind it). Note that this assumes the host always reveals a donkey (never the car) and always offers you the chance to switch, which is how the puzzle is defined.\n\n### Quick Explanation\n- When you initially pick a door, you have a **1/3 chance** of having picked the car (and a **2/3 chance** of having picked a donkey).\n- The host then opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a donkey. This doesn't change the initial probabilities\u2014it's just giving you information in a clever way.\n- If you stick with your original door, your odds of winning the car remain **1/3**.\n- If you switch to the remaining unopened door, your odds of winning the car improve to **2/3**.\n\nWhy the difference? Because:\n- If your initial pick was the car (1/3 odds), the host reveals a donkey behind one of the other doors. Switching would then lose you the car.\n- If your initial pick was a donkey (2/3 odds), the host is *forced* to reveal the other donkey (he can't reveal the car). Switching would then win you the car.\n- In other words, switching wins whenever your initial pick was wrong...which is 2/3 of the time!\n\nThis has been mathematically proven and even empirically tested countless times (including on real game shows and in simulations). It's counterintuitive at first\u2014many people (including mathematicians when the problem was first popularized) think the odds are 50/50 after the host reveals a donkey. But they're not, because the host's reveal is not random; he knows what's behind the doors and is deliberately avoiding the car.\n\n### What If You Don't Believe Me?\n- Try simulating it yourself with a friend and three cups (one hiding a \"prize\"). Play the game 20-30 times, always switching vs. always sticking, and count your wins. The results will match what I described.\n- There are endless free online Monty Hall simulators (just search for them) that let you play thousands of rounds in seconds.\n- For a deeper dive, look up the Monty Hall problem on Wikipedia or watch explanations on YouTube (e.g., from Numberphile or Vsauce). Books like *The Drunkard's Walk* by Leonard Mlodinow also cover it.\n\nIf your puzzle has unusual rules or twists (e.g., the host doesn't always reveal a donkey or offer a switch), provide more details and I'll reassess!",

This gives you a 2/3 (66.7%) chance of winning the car, while sticking with your original door gives you only a 1/3 (33.3%) chance.\n\n### Quick Explanation\n- At the start, your odds of having picked the car are 1/3 (and 2/3 that it's behind one of the other two doors).\n- The host (who knows what's where) *always* reveals a donkey behind one of the remaining doors. This doesn't change your initial 1/3 odds of being right...but it does concentrate the remaining 2/3 odds behind the one other unopened door.\n- As a result, switching wins 2/3 of the time in the long run.
