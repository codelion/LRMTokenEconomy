When two people cross together, they must move at the speed of the slower person. The torch must be carried back and forth.\n\nThe key insight is that we want to minimize the impact of the slowest crossers (C at 5 min and D at 10 min). The best strategy is typically to have them cross together.\n\nHere's the optimal solution:\n\n1. **A and B cross together** (3 minutes)\n   - Takes 3 minutes (B's speed)\n   - Both are now on the far side\n\n2. **A returns with torch** (1 minute)\n   - Takes 1 minute\n   - A is back on starting side, B stays on far side\n\n3. **C and D cross together** (10 minutes)\n   - Takes 10 minutes (D's speed)\n   - C and D are now on far side with B\n\n4. **B returns with torch** (3 minutes)\n   - Takes 3 minutes\n   - B is back on starting side with A\n\n5. **A and B cross together** (3 minutes)\n   - Takes 3 minutes\n   - Everyone is now on the far side\n\n**Total time: 3 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 20 minutes**\n\nHowever, I notice the problem states they need to cross in \"no more than 17 minutes.\" With the given crossing times (A=1, B=3, C=5, D=10), the mathematical minimum I can achieve is 20 minutes. I've verified this by checking all possible combinations.\n\nThe discrepancy suggests either:\n- There may be an error in the problem statement (perhaps B=2 instead of 3, which would give exactly 17 minutes)\n- Or there's additional information or a special condition not mentioned\n\nWith the times as stated, 20 minutes is the best possible solution using the strategy outlined above.",
