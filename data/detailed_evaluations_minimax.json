        "original_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\), we start by noting that \\( n + 2 \\) must divide \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). \n\nUsing modular arithmetic, we substitute \\( n \\equiv -2 \\pmod{n + 2} \\). This gives:\n\\[\nn + 3 \\equiv (-2) + 3 = 1 \\pmod{n + 2}\n\\]\n\\[\nn^2 + 9 \\equiv (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 \\pmod{n + 2}\n\\]\nThus, the product \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\equiv 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 13 = 39 \\pmod{n + 2} \\). For \\( n + 2 \\) to divide the product, \\( 39 \\) must be congruent to 0 modulo \\( n + 2 \\). Therefore, \\( n + 2 \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39. Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( n + 2 \\) must be at least 3. The valid divisors are 3, 13, and 39, leading to:\n\\[\nn + 2 = 3 \\implies n = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nn + 2 = 13 \\implies n = 11\n\\]\n\\[\nn + 2 = 39 \\implies n = 37\n\\]\n\nSumming these values, we get \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",

A compromise was reached to build a new capital.  \n3. **Canberra's Designation:** The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was established, and Canberra was planned as the capital, officially becoming the seat of government in 1927.  \n4. **Verification:** Canberra is home to key institutions like the Parliament House and the High Court, confirming its status as the capital.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nCanberra.",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Key Setup:\n- **Doors**: 1 donkey (D), 2 cars (C1, C2).\n- **Player's initial choice**: 1 door (A, B, or C).\n- **Host's action**: Opens a door with a luxury car.\n- **Goal**: Decide whether to stay or switch to maximize the chance of winning a car.\n\n---\n\n### Case Analysis:\n1. **Player initially picks the donkey (D):**\n   - **Probability**: 1/3.\n   - **Host's action**: Opens either remaining car (C1 or C2).\n   - **Outcome if switching**: Player switches to the other car (win).\n   - **Outcome if staying**: Player keeps D (lose).\n\n2. **Player initially picks a car (C1 or C2):**\n   - **Probability**: 2/3.\n   - **Host's action**: Must open the **other car** (e.g., if player picks C1, host opens C2).\n   - **Outcome if switching**: Player switches to D (lose).\n   - **Outcome if staying**: Player keeps their initial car (win).\n\n---\n\n### Probability Calculation:\n- **Probability of winning by staying**:\n  - Occurs if the initial pick was a car: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n- **Probability of winning by switching**:\n  - Occurs if the initial pick was the donkey: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Stay with the original door**. This strategy gives a \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) chance of winning a car, while switching only gives \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Stay}}",
