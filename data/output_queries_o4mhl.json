I already found solutions for both scenarios where y = 0 and y \u2260 0. The analysis of rational slopes led me to realize that the non-zero solutions from two families netted 117 pairs in total. I also confirmed that (0, 0) is the only intersection point between the families. So the final answer for the user is 117.**Finalizing the answer**\n\nI\u2019m concluding that the total number of ordered pairs is 117. This reflects both the solution to the problem and any edge cases I considered when testing the bounds for x and y. My calculations are effectively handled by the given bounds.

To do this, I'll analyze the quadratic equation for x in terms of y. Two trivial solutions stand out: (0, 0) is one, as that satisfies the equation entirely. Additionally, if y = 0, the only solution for x is again 0. So, it looks like these conditions limit the possible solutions quite a bit.**Finding integer solutions**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the only trivial solution with one coordinate being zero is (0, 0). To find non-trivial solutions, both x and y must be non-zero. I can express the equation in terms of the ratio x/y, which leads to a quadratic that I can solve. This gives me two cases for integer solutions based on k values. \n\nFor the first case (x = 3k, y = 4k), there are 51 possible k values. The second case (x = 2k, y = -3k) allows for 67 k values.

Normally, the potential choice has a 1/3 chance of picking the car and a 2/3 chance of choosing a goat. However, in this case, the donkey is equivalent to the goat, and there are winning doors behind two out of three choices. The host reveals a car, which differs from the classic scenario where only losing doors are opened.**Analyzing the host's reveal**\n\nThis scenario is intriguing: the host reveals a luxury car instead of a goat, which is typical.

        "**Analyzing the Monty Hall Problem**\n\nThe user is exploring the Monty Hall problem, which involves choosing one of three doors with varying prizes behind them. In this case, one door hides a donkey while the other two conceal luxury cars. The key insight is that you should always switch doors after the host reveals a car behind one of the remaining doors. This increases your probability of winning a car to 2/3, as you initially had only a 1/3 chance of picking the donkey.**Exploring the Monty Hall Scenario**\n\nIn this twist on the Monty Hall problem, the host intentionally reveals a car behind one of the doors. If the player picks the donkey initially, switching yields a car because at least one car is left. If they pick a car, switching leads to the donkey instead. The probabilities show that if the player switches, they win only if their initial choice was the donkey, which happens 1/3 of the time. Staying with the original choice wins 2/3 of the time, which highlights the unique aspect of this scenario.**Deciding in the Monty Hall Variation**\n\nIn this version of the Monty Hall problem, the host reveals a luxury car instead of a goat. If you stick with your initial choice, you have a 2/3 chance of winning a car, while switching only gives you a 1/3 chance. The reasoning is straightforward: if your first choice is the donkey (which happens 1/3 of the time), switching wins you a car. Conversely, if you initially pick a car (2/3 chance), switching leads to a donkey. So, it's best to stay with your original choice.**Deciding to Stick or Switch**\n\nIn this scenario, if you stick with your initial choice, you have a 2/3 chance of winning a car, while switching only gives you a 1/3 chance. That's because if there are two cars and you originally choose the donkey, switching will win you a car. So, the best strategy is to keep your original choice. Therefore, the final answer is: \"Keep your original door (don't swap).\" This maximizes your winning probability.",

Now, I'm wondering which of the remaining three boxes the customer should pick, if at all. Initially, the probability of the defective box being among the three is 3/4, but the probability shifts when one box is revealed as good. Since all remaining boxes are equally likely, it\u2019s symmetrical, leaving each box with an equal chance of being defective.**Evaluating box selection strategy**\n\nThe probability of the defective box being among the three remaining after opening one is 1. Each of the three boxes has a 1/3 chance of being the defective one, meaning they all have a 2/3 chance of being good. If the customer could initially choose from all four, the chance of getting a good one would be 3/4. However, if he picks from the three unopened boxes, the chance drops to 2/3. I'm considering if the best strategy is to choose the tested box since it is guaranteed to be good.**Deciding on the best box choice**\n\nThe customer should ideally pick the tested box since it\u2019s confirmed to be good. However, if the clerk randomly opens one and finds it good, there\u2019s a question of conditional probability at play. The remaining unopened boxes have equal chances of being defective, each with a 2/3 chance of being good. If possible, the safest choice remains the tested box. If that option isn\u2019t available, choosing from the other unopened boxes provides no advantage since their probabilities are equal.**Choosing the right box**\n\nThe customer has a choice after the clerk tests one box and finds it good. Ideally, the tested box is the best choice since it\u2019s guaranteed to be non-defective. However, if the clerk randomly tests one box, it influences the probabilities of the others. While each of the three untested boxes has a 2/3 chance of being good, the tested box has a 100% certainty of being good. So, if allowed, picking the tested box is the smartest move, but this depends on whether the clerk signifies which one was tested.**Deciding on the tested box**\n\nThe customer should choose the box that the clerk tested since it's confirmed to be non-defective. If the clerk reseals the tested box and the others become indistinguishable, then the test loses its value\u2014each box would share equal odds.

Each of the remaining boxes has updated probabilities since one box that was tested is good, altering the strategy. So, instead of picking based on the clerk\u2019s test, they should choose from the remaining three boxes!**Determining box choice strategy**\n\nAll boxes are equally likely to be defective since the clerk tested one at random, leaving the customer to choose among the remaining three.

Otherwise, any of the unopened boxes could work!**Clarifying box selection strategy**\n\nThe puzzle likely aims to compare with Monty Hall, but it doesn't apply here since the clerk opens a box at random.

        "**Analyzing box selection**\n\nI'm pondering a classic problem: a customer in a hardware store considering which appliance box to choose from a stack of four. A sales clerk tests one box and confirms it's fine. Now, I need to determine which box the customer should pick to maximize the chances of selecting a non-defective one. Each box initially had a 1/4 chance of being defective. After the clerk's test, I wonder if this alters the probabilities for the remaining boxes: should the customer stick to the unopened ones or just opt randomly?**Evaluating box selection probabilities**\n\nI'm reconsidering the scenario: a clerk tests box 1 and finds it good, which means its probability of being defective drops to zero. So now, at least one of the other three boxes must contain the defect. This means each unopened box has a 1/3 chance of being defective, and the tested box is the known good one. \n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: if the clerk tests until finding a non-defective box, it complicates things. Since he tests one and stops, I wonder how that influences our understanding of the hidden defective box.**Clarifying the box selection scenario**\n\nI'm thinking through the situation where a clerk tests a box and finds it good. If he randomly opened a defective one, he might keep testing until he finds a working one, but the prompt only mentions that he opens one box and finds it flawless.

If the clerk's action implies a hidden defective, then I wonder about the implications for the remaining boxes. Ultimately, given that the tested box is good, it seems straightforward to pick that one. However, the nuances make it feel less trivial than it might first appear.**Deciding on box selection**\n\nI\u2019m concluding that the customer should choose the box that was opened and tested by the clerk. This box has a defect probability of zero, while each unopened box still has a 1/3 chance of being defective.

Therefore, the customer should always opt for the tested box because it's the only one confirmed to be good, making it the best choice.**Choosing the best box**\n\nThe best choice for the customer is to pick the box that the clerk tested and confirmed as good. While it may seem trivial, this choice guarantees a flawless appliance, unlike the other three boxes, which each carry a risk of being defective.

Therefore, choosing the tested box maximizes the chances of a good outcome, making it the recommended pick.**Choosing the tested box**\n\nThe customer should pick the box that the clerk tested, as it\u2019s guaranteed to be non-defective. In this scenario, there\u2019s one defective appliance among four, meaning the other three have a 1/3 chance of being good, while the tested one has a 100% success rate.
