This is because your initial choice has a 1/3 probability of being correct, while the switching strategy has a 2/3 probability of winning. \n\nHere's why:\n- When you first pick a door, there is a 1/3 chance that you picked the car and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n- The host, who knows what is behind the doors, always opens a door with a donkey. This action does not change the initial probabilities but provides additional information.\n- By switching, you effectively win if the car was behind either of the two doors you didn't initially pick, which has a 2/3 probability. If you stay, you win only if you were initially correct, which is only 1/3.\n\nThus, swapping doubles your chances of winning the car.",

The times are: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, C takes 5 minutes, and D takes 10 minutes. To get all four across in exactly 17 minutes, follow this sequence:\n\n1. A and B cross together to the other side. Time taken: 2 minutes (since B is slower).  \n   - Total time: 2 minutes.  \n2. A returns with the torch to the starting side. Time taken: 1 minute.  \n   - Total time: 2 + 1 = 3 minutes.  \n3. C and D cross together to the other side. Time taken: 10 minutes (since D is slower).  \n   - Total time: 3 + 10 = 13 minutes.  \n4. B returns with the torch to the starting side. Time taken: 2 minutes.  \n   - Total time: 13 + 2 = 15 minutes.  \n5. A and B cross together to the other side. Time taken: 2 minutes (since B is slower).  \n   - Total time: 15 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nNow all four are on the other side with the torch in 17 minutes.\n\nNote: If B takes 3 minutes instead of 2, the total time would be 20 minutes, which exceeds 17. Therefore, for the solution to work within 17 minutes, B must take 2 minutes. The problem statement may have a typo regarding B's time.",
