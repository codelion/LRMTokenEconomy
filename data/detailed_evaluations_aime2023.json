For a polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients, we have $a-b \\mid P(a)-P(b)$ for any distinct integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nLet $x=n$. We can view $P(n)$ as the evaluation of the polynomial $P(x) = 3(x+3)(x^2+7)$ at $x=n$.\nLet $a=n$ and $b=-2$. Then, according to the property, $n-(-2)$ must divide $P(n) - P(-2)$.\nThis means $n+2 \\mid P(n) - P(-2)$.\n\nWe are given that $n+2 \\mid P(n)$.\nIf $n+2$ divides both $P(n)$ and $P(n) - P(-2)$, it must also divide their difference:\n$n+2 \\mid P(n) - (P(n) - P(-2))$, which simplifies to $n+2 \\mid P(-2)$.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the value of $P(-2)$.\n$P(-2) = 3((-2)+3)((-2)^2+7)$\n$P(-2) = 3(1)(4+7)$\n$P(-2) = 3(11)$\n$P(-2) = 33$.\n\nSo, the condition simplifies to $n+2$ must be a divisor of 33.\nThe divisors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, and 33. Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n \\ge 1$.\nThis implies that $n+2 \\ge 1+2 = 3$.\nSo, $n+2$ must be a divisor of 33 that is greater than or equal to 3.\nThe possible values for $n+2$ are 3, 11, and 33.\n\nWe find the corresponding values of $n$ for each case:\n1. If $n+2 = 3$, then $n = 3-2 = 1$. This is a positive integer.\n2. If $n+2 = 11$, then $n = 11-2 = 9$. This is a positive integer.\n3. If $n+2 = 33$, then $n = 33-2 = 31$. This is a positive integer.\n\nThe set of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition is $\\{1, 9, 31\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the sum of all such positive integers $n$.\nSum = $1 + 9 + 31 = 41$.\n\nTo verify, we can check these values:\n- For $n=1$: $n+2=3$. $3(1+3)(1^2+7) = 3(4)(8)=96$. $96$ is divisible by $3$.\n- For $n=9$: $n+2=11$. $3(9+3)(9^2+7) = 3(12)(88)$. This is divisible by $11$ because of the factor $88$.\n- For $n=31$: $n+2=33$. $3(31+3)(31^2+7) = 3(34)(961+7) = 3(34)(968)$. This is divisible by $3$. To check for divisibility by $11$, we check the factors: $968 = 11 \\times 88$, so $968$ is divisible by $11$. Thus the whole product is divisible by $3 \\times 11 = 33$.\n\nThe logic and calculations are correct.\n\n",

Let the terms of the sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$.\n\nLet the least number of apples on any of the six trees be $x$.\nAccording to the problem statement, the greatest number of apples on any of the six trees is double the least number. So, the greatest number of apples is $2x$.\n\nFor an arithmetic sequence, the least and greatest terms are always the first and last terms, regardless of whether the common difference ($d$) is positive or negative (as long as $d \\ne 0$).\nIf $d > 0$, the sequence is increasing, so $a_1 = x$ (least) and $a_6 = 2x$ (greatest).\nIf $d < 0$, the sequence is decreasing, so $a_6 = x$ (least) and $a_1 = 2x$ (greatest).\nIf $d = 0$, all terms are equal, so $a_1 = a_6 = x$. Then $x = 2x$ implies $x=0$. In this case, the total sum would be $6 \\times 0 = 0$, not $2970$. So $d \\ne 0$.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this problem, $n=6$. The sum of the apples on all six trees is $S_6 = 2970$.\nThe first term and last term are, respectively, the least and greatest numbers of apples (or vice-versa).\nSo, we can write the sum as:\n$S_6 = \\frac{6}{2}(\\text{least number} + \\text{greatest number})$\n$2970 = 3(x + 2x)$\n$2970 = 3(3x)$\n$2970 = 9x$\n\nNow, we solve for $x$:\n$x = \\frac{2970}{9}$\n$x = 330$\n\nThe least number of apples is $330$.\nThe question asks for the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees.

Given \\(G = 2L\\).\n\nThe average number of apples per tree is the total divided by the number of trees, so \\(\\frac{2970}{6} = 495\\).\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence with an even number of terms, the average of all terms is equal to the average of the first and last terms. Since the least and greatest terms are at the ends of the sequence (as the sequence is monotonic), the average is also the average of the least and greatest terms. Thus:\n\\[\n\\frac{L + G}{2} = 495\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(G = 2L\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{L + 2L}{2} = \\frac{3L}{2} = 495\n\\]\nSolving for \\(L\\):\n\\[\n3L = 495 \\times 2 = 990\n\\]\n\\[\nL = \\frac{990}{3} = 330\n\\]\nThen:\n\\[\nG = 2L = 2 \\times 330 = 660\n\\]\nThus, the greatest number of apples is 660.\n\nTo verify, the common difference \\(d\\) is:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{G - L}{5} = \\frac{660 - 330}{5} = \\frac{330}{5} = 66\n\\]\nThe sequence is \\(330, 396, 462, 528, 594, 660\\). The sum is:\n\\[\n330 + 396 = 726, \\quad 726 + 462 = 1188, \\quad 1188 + 528 = 1716, \\quad 1716 + 594 = 2310, \\quad 2310 + 660 = 2970\n\\]\nThe sum is 2970, and the greatest number (660) is double the least (330), confirming the solution.\n\nAlternatively, pairing terms: \\(330 + 660 = 990\\), \\(396 + 594 = 990\\), \\(462 + 528 = 990\\), and \\(3 \\times 990 = 2970\\), which also confirms the sum.\n\nThus, the greatest number of apples on any tree is 660.\n\n\\boxed{660}",
