        "Since the bridge can hold all four at once, the trick is to have everybody cross together.

Their speed is determined by the slowest member\u2014D, who takes 10 minutes. Thus they all get across in exactly 10 minutes.",
        "Since the bridge can support all four at the same time, they simply need to cross together with the torch. When they cross as a group, they must keep pace with the slowest person\u2014which is D, taking 10 minutes. Thus, all four can get across in exactly 10 minutes.",
        "Since the bridge can hold all four people at once, they can simply all cross together. When a group crosses, they must go at the pace of the slowest member. In this case, person D takes 10 minutes to cross. Therefore, if all four cross at the same time with the torch, they finish in exactly 10 minutes.\n\nSo the solution is: All four people step onto the bridge together carrying the single torch, and they all cross in 10 minutes (since 10 is the slowest individual\u2019s time).",
        "Since the bridge can support all four people at one time, they can simply cross together as a group. The time it takes for a group crossing is determined by the slowest person in that group. Here, person D takes 10 minutes. Thus, if all four cross together with the single torch, the entire group will be on the other side in 10 minutes, meeting the time requirement.\n\nAnswer: All four cross together, and since the slowest (D) takes 10 minutes, the crossing is completed in 10 minutes.",
        "Because the bridge can hold all four people at once, the simplest solution is to have everyone cross together. In that case, they all walk side\u2010by\u2010side carrying the torch, and the speed of the crossing is set by the slowest person (D, who takes 10 minutes). Thus, all four can make it in 10 minutes.\n\nIn many \u201cbridge and torch\u201d puzzles the trick is that only two people can cross at a time so that you must shuttle the torch back and forth. Here, the bridge\u2019s capacity lets you avoid that extra leg of the journey.\n\nSo the answer is: All four people cross together with the torch, taking 10 minutes total."

Since we want m | 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 \u2013 4m + 11), we consider the expression modulo m. Notice that:\n\u2003\u2003m + 1 \u2261 1 (mod m)\n\u2003\u2003m\u00b2 \u2013 4m + 11 \u2261 11 (mod m) \nSo, 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 \u2013 4m + 11) \u2261 3 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 11 = 33 (mod m).\n\nTherefore, the divisibility condition is equivalent to m dividing 33:\n\u2003\u2003m | 33.\n\nStep 4.

The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39.\n\nRemember that d = n + 2 must be at least 3 since n is positive (if d = 1 then n = -1 which is not allowed). Hence, we discard d = 1.\n\nFor the remaining divisors:\n\u2003\u2003If d = 3, then n = 3 \u2212 2 = 1.\n\u2003\u2003If d = 13, then n = 13 \u2212 2 = 11.\n\u2003\u2003If d = 39, then n = 39 \u2212 2 = 37.\n\nStep 5.

This means that n + 2 must be a divisor of 39.\n\nStep 2. Find the positive divisors of 39: The divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39.\n\nStep 3. For each divisor d = n + 2, find n:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If n + 2 = 1 then n = -1 (reject, n must be positive).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If n + 2 = 3 then n = 1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If n + 2 = 13 then n = 11.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If n + 2 = 39 then n = 37.\n\nThus, the positive integers n that work are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nStep 4.

The divisibility condition is that d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 \u2212 4d + 13).

It's possible that the red flowers belong to another subgroup of flowers. Therefore, we cannot conclude that some roses are red solely based on the given information.",
        "We cannot conclude that some roses are red. \n\nThe argument is as follows: While every rose is a flower, knowing that some flowers are red doesn't necessarily mean that any of those red flowers are roses. The red flowers could all be from another subgroup of flowers. Hence, the information provided isn\u2019t enough to conclude that any rose is red.",
        "No, we cannot conclude that some roses are red. Here's why:\n\nThe first statement tells us that all roses are in the group of flowers. The second statement tells us that some flowers are red. However, these statements don't guarantee any overlap between roses and the red flowers. The red flowers mentioned could be any type of flower other than roses. Therefore, from the given premises alone, we cannot logically infer that any roses are red.",

Therefore, the conclusion that \"some roses are red\" does not logically follow from the given statements.",

Factor the Equation\n\nWe can view the equation as quadratic in x:\n\u2003\u200312x\u00b2 \u2013 yx \u2013 6y\u00b2 = 0.\nUsing the quadratic formula for x,\n\u2003\u2003x = [y \u00b1 \u221a(y\u00b2 + 4\u00b712\u00b76\u00b7y\u00b2)] / (2\u00b712).\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\u2003\u2003\u0394 = y\u00b2 + 288y\u00b2 = 289y\u00b2,\nso \u221a\u0394 = 17|y|.

Analyze Each Case\n\nCase 1: x = (3/4)y\n\u2003For both x and y to be integers, y must be divisible by 4.\n\u2003Let y = 4k, where k is an integer. Then x = 3k.\n\u2003Now, the bounds \u2013100 \u2264 y \u2264 100 become:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013100 \u2264 4k \u2264 100\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u201325 \u2264 k \u2264 25.\n\u2003There are 25 \u2013 (\u201325) + 1 = 51 integer values for k.\n\u2003Each k gives a valid (x, y) pair.\n\nCase 2: x = (\u20132/3)y\n\u2003For x to be an integer, y must be divisible by 3.\n\u2003Let y = 3m, where m is an integer.

Count Unique Ordered Pairs\n\nNotice that the pair (0, 0) arises in both cases (when k = 0 and m = 0).\nThus, if we simply add the counts from the two cases, we would count (0, 0) twice.\n\nSo the total number of distinct solutions is:\n\u2003\u200351 (from Case 1) + 67 (from Case 2) \u2013 1 (for the duplicate (0,0)) = 117.\n\nThus, the answer is 117.",

Checking:\n\u2003\u20033\u00b74 = 12,\n\u2003\u20033(\u22123) + 4(2) = \u22129 + 8 = \u22121,\n\u2003\u20032(\u22123) = \u22126.\n\nThus, the factorization is\n\n\u2003\u2003(3x + 2y)(4x \u2212 3y) = 0.\n\nStep 2. Solve Each Factor Separately\n\nSince the product is zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.\n\nCase 1: 3x + 2y = 0\n\nSolve for y:\n\u2003\u20032y = \u22123x\u2003\u27f9\u2003y = \u2212(3/2)x.\nFor y to be an integer, x must be even.

Alternatively, solve by letting y be the parameter: let y = 4k, then\n\u2003\u2003x = 3k.\nThe bounds now require:\n\u2003\u2003x = 3k: \u2212100 \u2264 3k \u2264 100  \u27f9  k must lie between about \u221233\u2153 and 33\u2153,\n\u2003\u2003y = 4k: \u2212100 \u2264 4k \u2264 100  \u27f9  \u221225 \u2264 k \u2264 25.\nThus, the integer k must be between \u221225 and 25.\nThe number of possible k in this case is 25 + 25 + 1 = 51.\nSo, there are 51 solutions from Case 2.\n\nStep 3. Remove the Double-Counted Solution\n\nThe two cases share a common solution when both factors are zero. Setting both equations gives:\n\u2003\u20033x + 2y = 0 and 4x \u2212 3y = 0.\nSolving, you can see that plugging y = (4/3)x into 3x + 2y gives (17/3)x = 0, so x = 0 and y = 0.\nThus, the solution (0, 0) is counted in both cases.\n\nStep 4.

Factor Using the Quadratic Formula\n\nWe can view the equation as a quadratic in y:\n\u2003\u200312x\u00b2 \u2013 x\u00b7y \u2013 6y\u00b2 = 0.\nIt is often easier to work with the y\u2010variable, so rewrite the equation by \u201cflipping\u201d the order:\n\u2003\u2003\u20136y\u00b2 \u2013 x\u00b7y + 12x\u00b2 = 0.\nMultiply the whole equation by \u20131:\n\u2003\u20036y\u00b2 + x\u00b7y \u2013 12x\u00b2 = 0.\n\nFor fixed x (and with x not identically 0 for now), this is a quadratic in y:\n\u2003\u20036y\u00b2 + x\u00b7y \u2013 12x\u00b2 = 0.\n\nIts discriminant is:\n\u2003\u2003D = x\u00b2 \u2013 4\u00b76\u00b7(\u201312x\u00b2) = x\u00b2 + 288x\u00b2 = 289x\u00b2.\nThen using the quadratic formula:\n\u2003\u2003y = [\u2013x \u00b1 \u221a(289x\u00b2)] / (2\u00b76) = [\u2013x \u00b1 17|x|] / 12.\nNotice the absolute value appears because \u221a(x\u00b2) = |x|.\n\nStep 2. Writing the Two Cases\n\nWe now have two candidate formulas for y (when x \u2260 0):\n\nCase A:\u2003y = (\u2013x + 17|x|) / 12,\nCase B:\u2003y = (\u2013x \u2013 17|x|) / 12.\n\nIt is simplest to consider separately the cases x > 0 and x < 0.\n\n\u2022 When x > 0, we have |x| = x, so:\n\u2003\u2003Case A:\u2003y = (\u2013x + 17x) / 12 = (16x)/12 = (4x)/3.\n\u2003\u2003Case B:\u2003y = (\u2013x \u2013 17x) / 12 = (\u201318x)/12 = \u2013(3x)/2.\n\n\u2022 When x < 0, write x = \u2013k with k > 0.

Counting the Solutions Within the Bounds\n\nNow we must count how many ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y \u2208 [\u2013100, 100] come from each family.\n\nA. For y = (4x)/3:\n\u2003For y to be an integer, (4x)/3 must be an integer. This happens exactly when x is a multiple of 3.\n\u2003Let x = 3k.

For k = 33, y = 132, which is too big. So we need:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013100 \u2264 4k \u2264 100\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003\u2003\u201325 \u2264 k \u2264 25.\n\u2003Thus, for this family, the valid k are from \u201325 to 25.\n\u2003The number of integers from \u201325 to 25 is 25 + 25 + 1 = 51.\n\nB.

The Special Case x = 0:\n\u2003When x = 0, substitute in the original equation:\n\u2003\u200312(0)\u00b2 \u2013 0\u00b7y \u2013 6y\u00b2 = \u20136y\u00b2 = 0\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003\u2003y = 0.\n\u2003Thus, (0, 0) is a solution.\n\u2003Notice that when we applied formulas in families A and B, x = 0 would yield y = 0 in both. We must be careful not to double count (0, 0).\n\nStep 4. Combine the Count\n\nCounting the solutions:\n\u2003\u2022 Family A (y = (4x)/3) gives 51 solutions.\n\u2003\u2022 Family B (y = \u2013(3x)/2) gives 67 solutions.\n\u2003\u2022 The solution (0, 0) has been counted in both families.

Consider the case y = 0 separately.\n\nIf y = 0, then the equation becomes 12x\u00b2 = 0, so x = 0. Thus, (0, 0) is a solution.\n\nStep 3.

This forces y to be a multiple of 4.\nLet y = 4k, where k is an integer.\nThen, x = 3k.\nNow apply the boundary restrictions:\n\u2003\u2003y = 4k must satisfy \u2013100 \u2264 4k \u2264 100, so \u201325 \u2264 k \u2264 25.\nAlso, x = 3k must satisfy \u2013100 \u2264 3k \u2264 100, giving \u201333 \u2264 k \u2264 33.\nThe stronger restriction is \u201325 \u2264 k \u2264 25.\nThus, k can take 51 integer values (from \u201325 to 25).\nSo, Family 1 contributes 51 solutions.\n\nFamily 2: x = (\u20132/3)y.\nFor x to be an integer, (\u20132/3)y must be an integer. This forces y to be a multiple of 3.\nLet y = 3m, where m is an integer.\nThen, x = \u20132m.\nNow apply the restrictions:\n\u2003\u2003y = 3m must satisfy \u2013100 \u2264 3m \u2264 100, so \u201333 \u2264 m \u2264 33.\nAlso, x = \u20132m must satisfy \u2013100 \u2264 \u20132m \u2264 100, which translates to \u201350 \u2264 m \u2264 50.\nThe stronger restriction is \u201333 \u2264 m \u2264 33.\nThus, m can take 67 integer values (from \u201333 to 33).\nSo, Family 2 contributes 67 solutions.\n\nStep 4. Avoid double counting the (0, 0) solution.\n\nNote that both families include the solution (0, 0) (when k = 0 and m = 0). Because we already counted (0, 0) in each family, we have double counted it once. Therefore, we must subtract 1 from the total.\n\nTotal number of solutions =\n\u2003\u2003Solutions from Family 1 + Solutions from Family 2 \u2013 1\n\u2003\u2003= 51 + 67 \u2013 1 = 117.\n\nThus, the total number of ordered pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation, subject to the constraints, is 117."

        "There\u2019s a famous \u201cbridge\u2010crossing\u201d puzzle with four people whose crossing times (in minutes) are usually 1, 2, 5, and 10\u2014and when the two slowest cross together the overall time adds up to 17 minutes. (In that version the optimal solution is:\n\n\u2003\u2022 A (1 minute) and B (2 minutes) cross \u2192 2 minutes  \n\u2003\u2022 A returns \u2192 1 minute (total 3)  \n\u2003\u2022 C (5 minutes) and D (10 minutes) cross together \u2192 10 minutes (total 13)  \n\u2003\u2022 B returns \u2192 2 minutes (total 15)  \n\u2003\u2022 Finally, A and B cross together \u2192 2 minutes (total 17).)\n\nHowever, the version you gave lists the times as 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes so that Person B takes 3 minutes rather than 2. In that case the same general strategy\n\n\u20031. A and B cross together  \n\u20032. A comes back  \n\u20033. C and D cross together  \n\u20034. B comes back  \n\u20035.

        "There\u2019s a classic \u201cbridge\u2010crossing\u201d puzzle whose best solution takes 17 minutes when the four people\u2019s speeds are 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. (Sometimes the puzzle is stated with times 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes, but with those numbers the best possible total time is 20 minutes.) \n\nAssuming the traditional version with speeds 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes (and labeling the people A, B, C, and D so that A = 1 minute, B = 2 minutes, C = 5 minutes, and D = 10 minutes), the winning strategy is as follows:\n\n1. A and B cross together. Time taken: 2 minutes (since they must go as slow as the slower person).\n2. A comes back with the torch. Time taken: 1 minute.\n3. C and D cross together. Time taken: 10 minutes.\n4. B goes back with the torch. Time taken: 2 minutes.\n5. Finally, A and B cross together again. Time taken: 2 minutes.\n\nWhen you add these times up, the total is 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 A & B cross (2 minutes)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 A returns (1 minute)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 C & D cross (10 minutes)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 B returns (2 minutes)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 A & B cross again (2 minutes)\n\nTotal time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nIf indeed the puzzle statement you saw uses B = 3 minutes, then no solution can beat 20 minutes. (The well\u2010known \u201c17\u2010minute solution\u201d presumes that B takes 2 minutes.)",
        "We\u2019re given four people whose individual crossing times are: \n\u2003\u2022\u2003A: 1 minute \n\u2003\u2022\u2003B: 3 minutes \n\u2003\u2022\u2003C: 5 minutes \n\u2003\u2022\u2003D: 10 minutes\n\nThe usual \u201cbridge\u2010and\u2010torch\u201d puzzle asks for a strategy to get everyone across when only two people can cross at a time (and someone must always return with the torch). A well\u2010known strategy for a similar puzzle uses times 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes and does indeed manage a 17\u2010minute solution. (That solution is: A and B cross (2 minutes), A returns (1 minute), C and D cross (10 minutes), B returns (2 minutes), then A and B cross again (2 minutes) for a total of 17 minutes.)\n\nHowever, with our times \u2013 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes \u2013 one \u201coptimal\u201d strategy is as follows:\n\n1. A and B cross \u2192 takes 3 minutes.\n2. A returns with the torch \u2192 takes 1 minute.\n3. C and D cross together \u2192 takes 10 minutes.\n4. B returns with the torch \u2192 takes 3 minutes.\n5. A and B cross again \u2192 takes 3 minutes.\n\nIf we add these up we get:\n\u20033 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 20 minutes.\n\nAnyone who has seen this puzzle will know that this is the best possible outcome under these conditions. In other words, with the provided crossing times the minimum total time needed is 20 minutes\u2014not 17.\n\nThus, if the challenge is \u201cto get all four across in no more than 17 minutes,\u201d then under these rules and times it is impossible. The best you can do is 20 minutes.\n\nAnswer: They cannot meet the 17\u2010minute limit. The optimal crossing (A & B cross, A returns, C & D cross, B returns, then A & B cross) totals 20 minutes.",
        "We\u2019ll show that with the four people having individual speeds A = 1 minute, B = 3 minutes, C = 5 minutes, and D = 10 minutes, any \u201clegal\u201d crossing plan (two at a time while sharing one torch, with one person always returning with the torch) requires at least 20 minutes. In other words, it is not possible to get all four across in 17 minutes with these times.\n\nFor example, one well\u2010known plan is as follows:\n\n1. A and B cross together. (They must go at the slower person\u2019s pace: 3 minutes.)\n2. A returns with the torch. (1 minute; cumulative time = 3 + 1 = 4 minutes.)\n3. C and D cross together. (They take 10 minutes; cumulative = 4 + 10 = 14 minutes.)\n4. B returns with the torch. (3 minutes; cumulative = 14 + 3 = 17 minutes.)\n5. Finally, A and B cross together again. (Another 3 minutes; total = 17 + 3 = 20 minutes.)\n\nNo matter how one orders the crossings, one always ends up with a total time of at least 20 minutes. (One reason is that the two slowest people, C and D \u2013 taking 5 and 10 minutes respectively \u2013 \u201cmust\u201d cross at some point and, to avoid extra long returns, the optimal strategy is to have them cross together. That forces a return trip by one of the faster people, and with B\u2019s speed being 3 minutes rather than 2 minutes, the best\u2010possible total is 20 minutes.)\n\nIt is possible that you\u2019ve seen a similar puzzle where the four people take 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes. In that variant the optimal plan\n\n\u2003\u20031. A and B cross (2 minutes),\n\u2003\u20032. A returns (1 minute; total 3),\n\u2003\u20033. C and D cross (10 minutes; total 13),\n\u2003\u20034. B returns (2 minutes; total 15),\n\u2003\u20035. A and B cross (2 minutes; total 17)\n\ngets everyone across in 17 minutes. But with B taking 3 minutes instead of 2, the best strategy takes 20 minutes.\n\nSo, to answer the question as stated (with times 1, 3, 5, and 10), it isn\u2019t possible to finish in 17 minutes\u2014the optimal solution takes 20 minutes.",
        "We\u2019ll show that any strategy for these four people takes at least 20 minutes\u2014and in particular, it is impossible to get them all across in only 17 minutes.\n\nTo explain briefly, suppose the four people are A, B, C, and D with crossing times of 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. Because the bridge can only hold two people at a time and someone must always bring the torch back, one common \u201cfastest\u2010shuttles\u201d strategy is as follows:\n\n1. A and B cross together \u2013 3 minutes.\n2. A returns with the torch \u2013 1 minute (total = 4 minutes).\n3. C and D cross together \u2013 10 minutes (total = 14 minutes).\n4. B returns with the torch \u2013 3 minutes (total = 17 minutes).\n5. Finally, A and B cross together again \u2013 3 minutes (total = 20 minutes).\n\nNo matter how you rearrange the trips, the unavoidable \u201cslow\u201d trips (especially when C and D must cross) force the total to be 20 minutes or more. (For example, if you try sending A with one of the slow ones, that slow person\u2019s time still must be paid, and additional return trips add extra minutes.)\n\nThus, the answer is: it cannot be done in 17 minutes; the best possible strategy takes 20 minutes."

        "We can \u201cbeat the clock\u201d by noticing that although the old \u201cbridge\u2010and\u2010torch\u201d puzzle is often played with a rule that only two people may cross at a time, in this version the rickety bridge \u201ccan support four people at a time.\u201d That means we are allowed to have groups of three or even (if it made sense) all four on the bridge together. (Of course the torch must be carried along with whoever is crossing.) \n\nIf you were forced to take only two at a time, the well\u2010known optimal solution with people who take 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes would take 20 minutes:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Step\u00a01. A (1\u2032) and B (3\u2032) cross together \u2192 takes 3 minutes.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Step\u00a02. A returns with the torch \u2192 +1 minute (total 4).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Step\u00a03. C (5\u2032) and D (10\u2032) cross together \u2192 +10 minutes (total 14).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Step\u00a04. B returns with the torch \u2192 +3 minutes (total 17).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Step\u00a05. A and B cross together again \u2192 +3 minutes (total 20).\n\nBut notice that under the \u201cbridge can support four\u201d rule we have extra leeway. In fact, we can take advantage of a \u201ctrio\u2010crossing\u201d so that we do not waste time on two \u201creturn\u201d trips. For example, one winning strategy is:\n\n\u20031. First trip (forward): Have A (1\u2032), C (5\u2032) and D (10\u2032) go together. Since they must walk as a unit holding the torch\u2014and the group\u2019s speed is set by its slowest member\u2014the crossing takes 10 minutes.\n\n\u20032. Return trip: One person must bring the torch back. The obvious choice is the fastest, A (1\u2032). Now the total time is 10 + 1 = 11 minutes.\n\n\u20033. Final trip (forward): Finally, A and B (3\u2032) cross together. Their crossing takes 3 minutes (the slower of the two) for a grand total of 11 + 3 = 14 minutes.\n\nAt the end of step\u00a03 all four people are safely on the far side\u2014and the whole procedure took only 14 minutes, well under the 17\u2010minute limit.\n\nThus, by \u201cthinking outside the pair\u2010only box\u201d and taking advantage of the extra capacity of the bridge, the four people can cross in just 14 minutes.",
        "There\u2019s a neat \u201ctrick\u2010solution\u201d to this version. Although many \u201cbridge and torch\u201d puzzles limit you to two people at a time, here the bridge is strong enough for four at once. That extra capacity lets you avoid the usual extra \u201creturn\u201d trips. One successful plan is as follows:\n\n1. First, have persons A, C, and D cross together. (They must stick together with the torch, and the \u201cspeed\u201d of a group is that of its slowest member \u2013 here 10 minutes.)\n2. Next, have the fastest person on that far side\u2014A\u2014return with the torch (1 minute).\n3. Finally, have A and B cross together (taking 3 minutes).\n\nThe total elapsed time is 10 + 1 + 3 = 14 minutes, which is within the 17\u2010minute limit.\n\nThis answer depends on using the fact that the bridge can support all (or at least three) people at once. (In the \u201cclassic\u201d bridge puzzle the bridge\u2019s narrowness limits you to two people crossing at a time\u2014which for these speeds would force a longer total time.)",
        "We\u2019ll show that the minimum\u2010time solution is achieved by having the two fastest people help ferry the torch; that is, have A (1 minute) and B (2 minutes) cross together, then have the fastest return, then send the two slowest together, have the second\u2013fastest return, and finally have the two fastest cross again.\n\n(Note: In many versions of this \u201cbridge and torch\u201d puzzle the four people\u2019s speeds are 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes rather than 1, 3, 5 and 10. If B really takes 3 minutes the solution below would take 20 minutes. However, since the challenge says \u201cno more than 17 minutes\u201d the intended puzzle is usually the 1\u20132\u20135\u201310 version.)\n\nHere\u2019s the optimal procedure for the 1\u20132\u20135\u201310 puzzle:\n\nStep\u00a01. A and B cross together.\n\u2003\u2003Time taken = 2 minutes (since they must go at the slower person\u2019s pace).\n\nStep\u00a02. A returns with the torch.\n\u2003\u2003Time taken = 1 minute.\n\u2003\u2003Total so far = 2 + 1 = 3 minutes.\n\nStep\u00a03. The two slowest\u2014C and D\u2014cross together.\n\u2003\u2003Time taken = 10 minutes.\n\u2003\u2003Total so far = 3 + 10 = 13 minutes.\n\nStep\u00a04. B, who is on the far side, returns with the torch.\n\u2003\u2003Time taken = 2 minutes.\n\u2003\u2003Total so far = 13 + 2 = 15 minutes.\n\nStep\u00a05. Finally, A and B cross together again.\n\u2003\u2003Time taken = 2 minutes.\n\u2003\u2003Total overall = 15 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nThus, by following the steps:\n\u2003\u2003A and B cross \u2192 A returns \u2192 C and D cross \u2192 B returns \u2192 A and B cross,\nall four people are across in exactly 17 minutes.\n\nIf instead the times were 1, 3, 5 and 10 then the analogous procedure\n\u2003\u2003A and B cross (3 minutes) \u2192 A returns (1 minute) \u2192 C and D cross (10 minutes) \u2192 B returns (3 minutes) \u2192 A and B cross (3 minutes)\nwould take 3 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 20 minutes, which is too long for the \u201c17\u2010minute\u201d challenge. \n\nSo, assuming the classic 1\u20132\u20135\u201310 setup, the answer is as above.",
        "At first glance this problem looks like the familiar \u201cbridge\u2010crossing puzzle\u201d where only two people can cross at a time. In that classic puzzle the optimal solution with persons taking 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes takes 17 minutes. (That solution is: \n\n\u2003\u2022 Step\u00a01: The 1\u2010minute and 2\u2010minute people cross (2 min).  \n\u2003\u2022 Step\u00a02: The 1\u2010minute person comes back (1 min; total 3 min).  \n\u2003\u2022 Step\u00a03: The 5\u2010minute and 10\u2010minute people cross (10 min; total 13 min).  \n\u2003\u2022 Step\u00a04: The 2\u2010minute person comes back (2 min; total 15 min).  \n\u2003\u2022 Step\u00a05: The 1\u2010minute and 2\u2010minute people cross again (2 min; total 17 min).)\n\nHowever, note that in the version you asked the bridge \u201ccan support four people at a time\u201d and the four people have speeds A = 1 minute, B = 3 minutes, C = 5 minutes and D = 10 minutes. With these numbers the standard two\u2010at\u2010a\u2010time strategies (which would require several trips back and forth) actually add up to 20 minutes. (For example, if you try the analogous method\u2014A and B cross [3 min], A returns [1 min, total 4], C and D cross [10 min, total 14], B returns [3 min, total 17] and finally A and B cross [3 min, total 20]\u2014you total 20 minutes.)\n\nThe key difference is that since the bridge is strong enough for all four at once, there is no need for a complicated sequence of crossings. They can all cross together. In that case the crossing time is determined by the slowest person\u2014in this case, D who takes 10 minutes.\n\nThus, the trick is to realize that with a bridge that can hold four people, the four individuals simply grab the torch and cross at the same time, and the whole party is across in only 10 minutes, which is safely under the 17\u2010minute limit.\n\nSo the answer is: All four cross together in one trip, which takes 10 minutes.",
        "We\u2019ll show one way to \u201cbeat\u201d the usual two\u2010person rule by taking advantage of the fact that the bridge can hold all four at once. (Note that many \u201cbridge\u2010and\u2010torch\u201d puzzles assume that only two people may cross at a time. In our version the bridge holds up to four people, so we can send three at a time if we choose.)\n\nRecall the individuals\u2019 crossing times:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003A takes 1 minute\n\u2003\u2022\u2003B takes 3 minutes\n\u2003\u2022\u2003C takes 5 minutes\n\u2003\u2022\u2003D takes 10 minutes\n\nBecause any group crossing must move at the speed of its slowest member, one clever solution is as follows:\n\nStep 1. Send A, B, and C together across. Since C is the slowest of these three, this trip takes 5 minutes.\n\nStep 2. Someone must return with the torch so that D (the only person left) can cross. Have the fastest person, A, come back. That takes 1 minute. (Total so far = 5 + 1 = 6 minutes.)\n\nStep 3. Now send A and D across together. The crossing is paced by D, so it takes 10 minutes.\n\nAdding the times: 5 + 1 + 10 = 16 minutes, which is under the 17\u2010minute limit.\n\nThus, by sending three people across first then having A return and finally A and D cross together, all four get safely over in 16 minutes."

      "prompt": "A customer comes into a hardware store and is about to pick up a boxed appliance from a stack of four. The sales clerk interrupts, 'one of the appliances may be defective' and proceeds to randomly open one of the boxes and test the product to find that one is in flawless order. Which box should the customer pick?",
      "llm": "o3-mini-high",
      "output": [
        "We start with four boxes, one of which may be defective (so three are good and one is bad). Before the customer chooses, the sales clerk takes one box totally at random and tests it. It turns out that the appliance in that box is flawless.\n\nNow, why does that matter?\n\nBecause the clerk\u2019s random test is subject to the following fact: if he had picked the defective box, his test would have revealed a defect. Since he saw no defect, his randomly chosen box must be one of the three good ones. That box is now known to be flawless.\n\nLet\u2019s think it through step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Initially, each box has a 1/4 chance of being defective and a 3/4 chance of being good.\n\n2. The clerk randomly picks one box. (He did not base his choice on any knowledge of which box is defective; his pick is random.)\n\n3. If the clerk\u2019s chosen box were the defective one (which would happen with probability 1/4), then his test would have shown a defect. But his test showed no defect. Therefore, we know that the clerk did not pick the defective box.\n\n4. That means the one box he opened is definitely nondefective. On the other hand, for each of the three remaining boxes the chance that it is defective hasn\u2019t \u201cimproved\u201d \u2013 in fact, after conditioning on the clerk having revealed a good appliance, each unopened box has a 1/3 chance to be the bad one (they \u201cshare\u201d the entire possibility of containing the defective appliance).\n\nThus, if the customer were to pick one of the unopened boxes he would be risking a 1/3 chance (about 33%) of ending up with the defective appliance. Meanwhile, the one box the clerk opened has been tested and is known to be flawless.\n\nSo, the best (and rational) choice is for the customer to pick the box that the clerk opened and found to be in flawless order.",
        "We can solve this by thinking through the situation step\u2010by\u2010step.\n\nImagine there are four boxes, one of which contains a defective appliance and three of which contain good ones. The customer is about to take an appliance, but before he does, the knowledgeable clerk deliberately opens one of the other boxes\u2014one he knows is good\u2014and shows that its contents are flawless.\n\nNow the customer faces a choice among the remaining boxes:\n\u2022 The box the clerk opened is known to be good.\n\u2022 The customer\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d pick (if he had one in mind) would only have a 75% chance of being good (since 3 of the 4 boxes are good) and therefore a 25% chance of being defective.\n\u2022 The other unopened boxes still \u201chide\u201d the possibility that one of them is defective.\n\nThe clerk\u2019s careful choice of a box to open (always a box with a good appliance) means that the verified box is 100% safe. In other words, the act of testing one box doesn\u2019t \u201creassign\u201d any extra chance to the remaining boxes; it simply gives you a guaranteed good option.\n\nThus, the customer\u2019s best strategy is to select the box that the clerk opened and tested. It is the only one whose safety has been demonstrated.",
        "We can solve the problem by analyzing the information as follows.\n\n\u2022 Initially there are four boxes, and the clerk warns that \u201cone of the appliances may be defective.\u201d (That is, one box contains a defect, while the other three are fine.)\n\n\u2022 The customer hadn\u2019t yet picked a box. Then the clerk randomly picks one box to test and shows that it contains a flawless appliance.\n\n\u2022 At first each of the four boxes had a 1 in 4 chance of being the defective one. Since the box the clerk tested came out good (and if it had been defective the test would have shown that), we now can eliminate that box as the culprit for being defective. That leaves three boxes among which the one defective appliance must lie. (In other words, each of the remaining three boxes has a 1\u20443 probability of being defective, and thus a 2\u20443 chance of being good.)\n\n\u2022 Thus, if you picked one of the remaining three boxes at random you\u2019d be facing a chance (2\u20443 probability) that it is good versus a 1\u20441 (or 100%) probability that the already-tested box is good.\n\nSo, rather than taking a risk with one of the three unopened boxes, the customer should choose the box that was already opened and shown to be flawless.\n\nAnswer: The customer should pick the box that the clerk already tested.",
        "We start with four boxes, one of which is (by the store\u2019s information) potentially defective. That means that before any testing, each box has an equal one\u2010in\u2010four chance of being the bad one.\n\nThe clerk then randomly selects one box to open. Had the clerk opened the defective one, he would have discovered a problem. But instead, he finds that the box he opens works flawlessly. This tells you for sure that the opened box is good. (In other words, its chance of being defective is now 0%.)\n\nOriginally, each unopened box still had a 1/4 chance, but knowing that the clerk\u2019s tested box is good (and that the defective appliance is not in it), the \u201crisky\u201d possibility is now squeezed into the remaining three boxes. In fact, by symmetry the entire \u201cdefect\u2010risk\u201d is shared equally among the three boxes, meaning each one now carries a 1/3 chance of being defective.\n\nSo, if you switch your choice to one of the unopened boxes, you are faced with a 1/3 chance of ending up with the defective appliance. On the other hand, if you take the tested box, you\u2019re guaranteed a flawless appliance.\n\nThus the best choice is to pick the box the clerk already opened and tested.",
        "We start with a stack of four boxes in which exactly one appliance may be defective (so three are good and one is defective). When the customer is about to choose one, the sales clerk, without using any \u201chost\u2019s knowledge\u201d trick, simply picks one of the four boxes at random and tests it \u2013 and it turns out to be flawless. This information is valuable.\n\nLet\u2019s label the boxes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Initially each box has a 1/4 chance of containing the defective appliance. The clerk\u2019s procedure is as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 He chooses a box at random (each with probability 1/4).\n\u2003\u2022 If the box he chooses contains the defective unit, then when he tests it, it would not be flawless\u2014and the customer would see a defect.\n\u2003\u2022 However, the clerk finds the tested appliance is flawless. This means that he definitely did not open the box with the defective appliance.\n\nNow, notice the following:\n\u20031. The box that the clerk actually opened has been directly checked and is known to be good.\n\u20032. That leaves three unopened boxes. Since one box is defective overall and it is now known that the tested box is good, the defective appliance must be in one of the three unopened boxes. (The chance, based on our updating below, is 100% that if there is a defect it\u2019s in one of the remaining three.)\n\nLet\u2019s make this more quantitative using conditional probabilities:\n\u2022 For any given box j (other than the one the clerk opened) the unconditional chance that it is defective was 1/4.\n\u2022 However, the clerk\u2019s action (randomly choosing a box) gives a 1/4 chance of having picked any particular box. But if a box contained a defect, the clerk\u2019s test would have shown a defect. Since the tested box turned out flawless, it means that none of that fault \u201crisk\u201d was taken with the tested box.\n\u2022 A quick Bayes\u2019 calculation shows that each of the three unopened boxes now has a probability of 1/3 of being the defective one (since together they must \u201cabsorb\u201d the full 100% chance of the defect being among them).\n\nSo, for any one of the three unopened boxes:\n\u2003\u2022 Probability defective = 1/3,\n\u2003\u2022 Probability good = 2/3.\n\nBy contrast, the box that the clerk opened is confirmed (100% known) to be good. \n\nThus, if the customer wants to be sure of getting a flawless appliance, his best bet is to choose the box that was tested by the clerk. Any of the unopened boxes still carries a 1-in-3 chance of being defective, while the tested one is proven flawless.\n\nAnswer: The customer should pick the box that the clerk opened and tested."

Here's why:\n\n- **First Crossing:** 3 minutes (A & B)\n- **First Return:** 1 minute (A)\n- **Second Crossing:** 10 minutes (C & D)\n- **Second Return:** 3 minutes (B)\n- **Final Crossing:** 3 minutes (A & B)\n\nAdding these up: 3 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 3 = **20 minutes**\n\nAttempting to reduce any of these steps would require overlapping crossings or splitting the slowest crossings, which violates the bridge's capacity constraints or results in longer total times.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the goal was to achieve the crossings within **17 minutes**, the optimal strategy requires **20 minutes**. This ensures that all constraints are met and all individuals safely cross the bridge.",
        "To solve the bridge-crossing puzzle within the given constraints, it's essential to optimize the crossing sequence to minimize the total time.

To fully transport everyone within 17 minutes is not feasible based on the given constraints. The minimal total time required to get all four individuals across the bridge is **20 minutes** following this sequence:\n\n1. **A and B cross:** 3 minutes (Total: 3)\n2. **A returns:** 1 minute (Total: 4)\n3. **C and D cross:** 10 minutes (Total: 14)\n4. **B returns:** 3 minutes (Total: 17)\n5. **A and B cross again:** 3 minutes (Total: 20)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAchieving the bridge crossing for all four individuals in **17 minutes** is not possible under the given constraints.

Here's why:\n\n### **Understanding the Scenario**\n\n1. **Initial Choice:** You have **3 doors**:\n   - **1 door** hides a **luxury car**.\n   - **2 doors** hide **donkeys**.\n\n2. **Your Selection:** Suppose you pick **Door A**.\n\n3. **Host's Action:** The host, who knows what's behind each door, **opens another door** (say, **Door B**) revealing a **donkey**.\n\n4. **Final Decision:** You're given the option to **stay with your original choice (Door A)** or **switch to the remaining unopened door (Door C)**.\n\n### **Probability Breakdown**\n\n- **Initial Probabilities:**\n  - **Door A (your choice):** 1/3 chance of having the **car**.\n  - **Door B:** 1/3 chance of having the **car**.\n  - **Door C:** 1/3 chance of having the **car**.\n\n- **After Host Opens Door B:**\n  - **Door B** is revealed to have a **donkey**, eliminating it from contention.\n  - **The combined probability of Doors A and C** is still **2/3**.\n\n- **Revised Probabilities:**\n  - **Door A (your initial choice):** **Still has a 1/3 chance** of hiding the **car**.\n  - **Door C (the other unopened door):** Now holds the **remaining 2/3 probability** of having the **car**.\n\n### **Why Switching is Better**\n\n- When you **stick with your initial choice (Door A)**, your probability of winning the car remains **1/3**.\n  \n- When you **switch to Door C**, your probability of winning the car increases to **2/3**.\n\n### **Illustrative Example**\n\nImagine the scenario is repeated **100 times**:\n\n- **Initial Choices:**\n  - **You pick the car** in about **33 times**.\n  - **You pick a donkey** in about **67 times**.\n\n- **If You Never Switch:**\n  - You **win the car** only the **33 times** you initially chose it.\n\n- **If You Always Switch:**\n  - When you initially picked the car (**33 times**), switching leads you to a donkey.\n  - When you initially picked a donkey (**67 times**), switching leads you to the car.\n  - **Total Wins:** **67 times**, which is roughly **2/3** of the trials.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy **switching doors**, you **double your chances** of winning the car, increasing from a **1/3 probability** to a **2/3 probability**. Therefore, **to maximize your chances of winning the luxury car, you should always choose to switch**.",
        "To maximize your chances of winning the car in this scenario, **you should choose to switch to the other unrevealed door**. Here's why:\n\n### **Understanding the Probabilities:**\n\n1. **Initial Choice:**\n   - When you first pick a door, there's a **1/3 chance** the car is behind your chosen door.\n   - There's a **2/3 chance** the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n\n2. **Host's Action:**\n   - The host knows what's behind each door and will always open a door revealing a donkey.\n   - If your initial choice was a donkey (which has a 2/3 probability), the host is forced to reveal the other donkey, leaving the car behind the remaining unopened door.\n   - If your initial choice was the car (1/3 probability), the host can open either of the two remaining doors, both of which have donkeys.\n\n3. **Decision to Switch:**\n   - **Staying with your initial choice:** You win the car **only if** your first pick was correct (1/3 probability).\n   - **Switching to the other door:** You win the car if your initial pick was a donkey (2/3 probability).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Probability of Winning by Staying:** 1/3\n- **Probability of Winning by Switching:** 2/3\n\nBy **switching**, you effectively double your chances of winning the car from **1/3** to **2/3**. This counterintuitive result is a classic example of how probability can defy our initial instincts.\n\n**Therefore, to maximize your chances of winning the car, you should switch to the other door.**",
        "This scenario is a classic probability puzzle known as the **Monty Hall Problem**, named after the host of the game show *Let's Make a Deal*. To maximize your chances of winning the luxury car, **you should always choose to switch doors**. Here's why:\n\n### Breakdown of the Probabilities:\n\n1. **Initial Choice:**\n   - There are **three doors**: one with a car and two with donkeys.\n   - **Probability you chose the car initially:** 1/3\n   - **Probability you chose a donkey initially:** 2/3\n\n2. **Host Reveals a Donkey:**\n   - The host knows what's behind each door and will always open a door revealing a donkey.\n   - This action doesn't change the initial probabilities but provides additional information.\n\n3. **Decision to Switch:**\n   - **If your initial choice was the car (1/3 chance):**\n     - Switching would lead you to a donkey.\n   - **If your initial choice was a donkey (2/3 chance):**\n     - Switching would lead you to the car.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Probability of Winning by Staying:** 1/3\n- **Probability of Winning by Switching:** 2/3\n\nBy **switching doors**, you effectively leverage the higher probability (2/3) that your initial choice was a donkey, thus increasing your chances of winning the car.\n\n### Intuitive Explanation:\n\nThink of it this way: When you make your initial choice, there's a 2/3 chance you didn't pick the car. The host's action of revealing a donkey doesn't change this probability; instead, it consolidates the 2/3 probability onto the remaining unopened door. Therefore, switching doors gives you a better chance of ending up with the car.\n\n**In summary:** To maximize your chances of winning the luxury car, **always choose to switch doors** after the host reveals a donkey behind one of the other doors."

      "prompt": "A customer comes into a hardware store and is about to pick up a boxed appliance from a stack of four. The sales clerk interrupts, 'one of the appliances may be defective' and proceeds to randomly open one of the boxes and test the product to find that one is in flawless order. Which box should the customer pick?",
      "llm": "o1-mini",
      "output": [
        "After the sales clerk tests and confirms that one of the four boxed appliances is flawless, the customer has the following options:\n\n1. **Choose the Tested Box:** This box is guaranteed to be good since it has been tested and found flawless.\n2. **Choose One of the Remaining Three Boxes:** Each of these boxes has a higher probability of containing the potentially defective appliance. Specifically, if there is exactly one defective appliance among the four, after removing one good box, there's a 1 in 3 chance that any of the remaining boxes is defective.\n\n**Probability Analysis:**\n\n- **Tested Box:** 100% chance of being good.\n- **Each Remaining Box:** Approximately 66.7% chance (2 out of 3) of being good.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo **maximize the certainty of obtaining a flawless appliance**, the customer should **choose the box that has already been tested and confirmed to be good**. This ensures there's no risk of selecting a defective unit.",
        "Let's analyze the scenario step by step to determine which box the customer should pick to maximize the chances of obtaining a flawless appliance.\n\n### Scenario Breakdown:\n1. **Total Boxes:** 4\n2. **Possibly Defective Boxes:** 1 (implying that exactly one box is defective)\n3. **Clerk's Action:** Randomly opens and tests one box, finding it to be flawless.\n\n### Initial Probabilities:\n- **Probability that any given box is flawless:** 3/4\n- **Probability that any given box is defective:** 1/4\n\n### After the Clerk Tests One Box:\n- The clerk has opened one box and confirmed it's flawless.\n- **Remaining Boxes:** 3\n- **Defective Boxes Remaining:** Still 1 (since the tested box was flawless)\n- **Flawless Boxes Remaining:** 2\n\n### Updated Probabilities for the Remaining Boxes:\n- **Probability that a specific remaining box is flawless:** 2/3\n- **Probability that a specific remaining box is defective:** 1/3\n\n### Recommendation:\nGiven that one box has been confirmed flawless, the customer now has three boxes to choose from:\n\n- **Option 1:** **Select the Tested Box**\n  - **Pros:** Guaranteed to be flawless.\n  - **Cons:** The scenario implies that the tested box has been set aside after verification and is not intended for sale.\n\n- **Option 2:** **Select Any of the Remaining Three Boxes**\n  - **Pros:** Each has a 2/3 chance of being flawless.\n  - **Cons:** There's still a 1/3 chance the selected box could be defective.\n\nAssuming the tested box is no longer available for selection (as it's been opened and verified by the clerk), the customer should choose **any of the remaining three boxes**. Each of these boxes now has a higher probability (2/3) of being flawless compared to the initial 3/4 probability before the clerk conducted the test.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**The customer should select one of the remaining three unopened boxes, each of which now has a 2\u20443 probability of being flawless.**",
        "After the sales clerk opens one box and confirms it's flawless, there are three remaining boxes, with one potentially defective appliance among them. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Probability:**\n   - Each of the four boxes initially had a 25% (1/4) chance of containing the defective appliance.\n\n2. **After Revealing One Flawless Box:**\n   - One box is eliminated from consideration, leaving three boxes.\n   - The defective appliance must be in one of these three boxes.\n   - Therefore, each of the remaining three boxes now has an equal 1/3 (approximately 33.3%) chance of containing the defective appliance.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- **No Specific Advantage:** Since all three remaining boxes have an equal probability of containing the defective appliance, there's no statistical advantage in choosing one box over another.\n- **Choose Any Box:** The customer can pick any of the three remaining boxes with the same likelihood of success.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe customer should feel equally confident picking any of the three remaining boxes, as each has an equal chance of containing a flawless appliance.",
        "The customer should **pick the box that has already been tested and found to be flawless**.

This action provides new information:\n   \n   - **If the tested box is flawless**, there are now three remaining boxes. Since only one box could have been defective originally, the probability that any of the remaining three boxes is defective is still 1 in 3.\n   \n3. **Decision Point**:\n   \n   - **Choosing the Tested Box**: Since the tested box is confirmed to be flawless, selecting it guarantees that the customer gets a good appliance.\n   \n   - **Choosing Another Box**: If the customer opts for a different box, there's a 1 in 3 chance that it's defective, and a 2 in 3 chance it's flawless.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: To **maximize the certainty of obtaining a flawless appliance**, the customer should select the already tested and verified box.\n\n**Answer:** Choose the already tested box, since it\u2019s confirmed to be flawless.",
