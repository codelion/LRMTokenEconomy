Therefore, the answer to \"How much is 1+1?\" is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nBut to be thorough, here's a more detailed summary:\n\nWe started by considering the standard decimal addition where 1 + 1 equals 2. We then explored other contexts such as binary (where it's represented as '10'), boolean algebra (where it equals 1), and modular arithmetic (where it could equal 0 in modulo 2). However, in the absence of any specific context, the default assumption is standard decimal addition.\n\nWe also considered if the '+' operation could represent something other than addition, like concatenation in strings or lists, but the question's format suggests numerical addition. Additionally, we thought about different numeral systems and representations, but in all standard bases, the decimal equivalent of 1 + 1 is 2.\n\nAfter considering various possibilities and confirming that in most common contexts 1 + 1 equals 2, we concluded that the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
