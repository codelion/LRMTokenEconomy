        "**Analyzing divisibility problem**\n\nI'm looking to find all positive integers n such that n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9). It seems I need to analyze how (n+2) divides the expression, and consider potential limitations. It\u2019s probably finite since the degrees of the numerator and divisor suggest a linear constraint. I can set k = n + 2, leading me to express everything in terms of k. Therefore, I can simplify my expressions and explore the division condition to find valid n values.**Summarizing divisibility findings**\n\nI've determined that since k equals n + 2, k must start at 3 for positive integers. I'm analyzing when k divides 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13). After some simplification, I've found that k needs to be a positive divisor of 39, specifically 3, 13, or 39. This gives possible n values of 1, 11, and 37. After double-checking, it turns out all these n satisfy the conditions, leading to a final sum of 49.**Finalizing the answer**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that the only valid values for k are positive divisors of 39. The sum of the corresponding n values is 49, which is the concise solution. I remember that we\u2019re focusing only on positive integers, so negative values aren\u2019t considered in this case. Therefore, the final answer is 49, succinctly stated. I'll present this clearly to ensure it\u2019s understood. So, I\u2019ll conclude with 49 as the final result.",

Thus, the final answer remains 49.**Finalizing the answer**\n\nI'm considering if the gcd could bring in any nontrivial factors, but since \\( k \\) divides the product, it leads me to confirm that \\( k \\) must divide 39.

        "**Analyzing divisors of 39**\n\nSo, I'm looking at the positive divisors of 39. The divisors greater than 2 are 3, 13, and 39.

        "Let the given condition be $n+2$ divides $3(n+3)(n^2+9)$.\nWe are looking for the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet $P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)$. The condition is $n+2 | P(n)$.\n\nWe can use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem. For a polynomial $P(x)$, the remainder upon division by $x-a$ is $P(a)$.\nIn our case, the polynomial is $P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)$ in the variable $n$, and the divisor is $n+2$, which can be written as $n-(-2)$. So, $a=-2$.\n\nThe remainder when $P(n)$ is divided by $n+2$ is $P(-2)$.\nLet's calculate this remainder:\n$P(-2) = 3((-2)+3)((-2)^2+9)$\n$P(-2) = 3(1)(4+9)$\n$P(-2) = 3(13)$\n$P(-2) = 39$.\n\nSo, we can write $P(n)$ in the form $P(n) = Q(n)(n+2) + 39$, where $Q(n)$ is the quotient polynomial.\nFor $n+2$ to divide $P(n)$, it must be that $n+2$ divides $Q(n)(n+2) + 39$.\nSince $n+2$ clearly divides $Q(n)(n+2)$, the condition simplifies to $n+2$ must divide the remainder, 39.\nSo, $n+2$ must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThe divisors of 39 are $1, 3, 13, 39$.\nThe problem states that $n$ must be a positive integer, which means $n \\ge 1$.\nThis imposes a condition on $n+2$:\n$n \\ge 1 \\implies n+2 \\ge 1+2 \\implies n+2 \\ge 3$.\n\nSo, $n+2$ must be a divisor of 39 that is greater than or equal to 3.\nThe possible values for $n+2$ are therefore $3, 13, 39$.\n\nWe can find the corresponding values of $n$ for each of these cases:\n1. If $n+2 = 3$, then $n = 3-2 = 1$.\n2. If $n+2 = 13$, then $n = 13-2 = 11$.\n3. If $n+2 = 39$, then $n = 39-2 = 37$.\n\nThese are all positive integers, so they are the solutions to the problem. The set of all positive integers $n$ satisfying the condition is $\\{1, 11, 37\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the sum of all such positive integers $n$.\nSum = $1 + 11 + 37$.\nSum = $12 + 37$.\nSum = $49$.\n\nTo verify, let's check one of the values, for instance $n=37$:\n$n+2 = 39$.\nThe product is $3(37+3)(37^2+9) = 3(40)(1369+9) = 3(40)(1378)$.\nWe need to check if 39 divides this product.\n$3(40)(1378) = 3 \\times (40) \\times (13 \\times 106) = (3 \\times 13) \\times 40 \\times 106 = 39 \\times (40 \\times 106)$.\nThis is clearly divisible by 39. The other values of $n$ can be checked similarly.\n\n"

I'll focus next on how this divisibility rule can be simplified or reframed.\n\n\n**Applying Modular Arithmetic**\n\nI've begun applying the principles of modular arithmetic. Considering `n+2` as the modulus, I'm substituting `n \u2261 -2` into the given expression. My focus now is calculating the remainder of `3(n+3)(n^2+9)` when `n = -2`.

I need to box the answer.\n\nFirst, since \\( n+2 \\) divides that product, I can write:\n\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n+2} \\]\n\nWorking with congruences might be messy. Instead, since \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor, I can let \\( d = n+2 \\), so n = d - 2. Then substitute into the product.\n\nLet \\( d = n + 2 \\), so n = d - 2.\n\nThen the product becomes:\n\n\\[ 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nAnd d divides this product: \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\)\n\nSince d divides this, and d is an integer (since n is positive integer, d = n+2 >= 3), so d >= 3.\n\nNow, d divides 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13). But d and d+1 are coprime, so d must divide 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), but since d and d+1 are coprime, the divisibility condition simplifies.\n\nActually, since d divides the product, and d may share factors with 3 or with (d^2 - 4d + 13).\n\nPerhaps better to write:\n\n\\[ 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d} \\]\n\nBut modulo d, d \u2261 0, so let's compute the expression modulo d.\n\nModulo d, d \u2261 0, so d+1 \u2261 1, and d^2 - 4d + 13 \u2261 0 - 0 + 13 \u2261 13 mod d.\n\nMore carefully:\n\nd^2 - 4d + 13 mod d: since d^2 \u2261 0, -4d \u2261 0, so yes, \u2261 13 mod d.\n\nAnd d+1 \u2261 1 mod d.\n\nSo the product is 3 * (d+1) * (d^2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 3 * 1 * 13 \u2261 39 mod d.\n\nIs that right? Modulo d, the entire product is congruent to 39 mod d, and it must be 0 mod d, since d divides it.\n\nBut d divides the product, so product \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nBut I just got product \u2261 39 mod d.\n\nThat can't be right because if d divides the product, it should be 0 mod d, but I have 39 mod d, so 39 \u2261 0 mod d, meaning d divides 39.\n\nIs that possible? Let me check.\n\nIn the congruence, when I say modulo d, and d divides the product, yes, product \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nAnd I computed that 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 3 * 1 * 13 \u2261 39 mod d, because d+1 \u2261 1, and d^2 - 4d + 13 \u2261 13 mod d.\n\nYes, so 39 \u2261 0 mod d, so d divides 39.\n\nOh, so d | 39.\n\nBut d = n+2, and n is positive integer, so d >= 3.\n\nAnd 39's positive divisors are 1,3,13,39. But d>=3, so possible d: 3,13,39.\n\nIs that all? But let me verify.\n\nSo if d divides 39, then d=3,13,39.\n\nThen n = d - 2, so for d=3, n=1; d=13, n=11; d=39, n=37.\n\nNow, check if n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nFirst, n=1: n+2=3, product 3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120, 120 / 3 =40, yes.\n\nn=11: n+2=13, product 3(14)(121+9)=3*14*130, n^2+9=121+9=130, yes.\n\n3*14*130=3*14=42, 42*130=5460, divide by 13: 13*420=5460, yes.\n\nn=37: n+2=39, product 3(40)(37^2 +9)=3*40*(1369+9)=120*1378.\n\n37^2=1369, yes, +9=1378.\n\nNow, 120*1378, but divide by 39.\n\nSince d=39 divides, and we have 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)=3(40)(39^2 -4*39 +13)=3*40*(1521 - 156 +13)=3*40*(1521-156=1365+13=1378? 1521-156=1365, +13=1378, yes.\n\nAnd 3*40*1378, and d=39, so 39 divides 3*40*1378.\n\nBut 39=3*13, and 3 is there, so need to check if 13 divides 40*1378.\n\n1378 / 13: 13*106=1378, yes, exactly, so yes.\n\nSo all three work.\n\nBut the problem asks for sum of all such positive integers n.\n\nSo n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, +37=49.\n\nIs that all?\n\nEarlier I assumed d divides 39, but is there any other possibility?\n\nIn the congruence, I said product \u2261 39 mod d, and must be 0 mod d, so d|39.\n\nBut is this always true?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nIn the modulo d, I assumed that d divides the product, so product \u22610 mod d.\n\nAnd I computed the product modulo d as 39.\n\nBut is this correct when d and the other factors have common factors?\n\nNo, in modular arithmetic, when we compute modulo d, it's fine, because the congruence holds regardless.\n\nFor example, if d divides d+1, but d and d+1 are coprime, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, d and d+1 are always coprime, and d and the constant 13, well, d could share factors with 13 or 3.\n\nBut in the congruence, it's still valid.\n\nFor instance, take d=3, which divides 39, and it worked.\n\nSuppose d does not divide 39, but perhaps if d shares factors with other parts.\n\nAccording to this, product \u226139 mod d, so if d does not divide 39, then product not \u22610 mod d, so d cannot divide the product.\n\nUnless... is there a case where the modulo calculation is wrong?\n\nFor example, if d divides d^2 -4d +13, but in modulo d, it's always 13, so if d does not divide 13, but wait.\n\nNo, the calculation seems solid.\n\nAnother way to think: the product is 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13), and since d and d+1 are coprime, for d to divide this product, d must divide 3(d^2 -4d +13), because d and d+1 coprime.\n\nMore carefully: since d and d+1 are coprime, d divides 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13) implies that d divides 3(d^2-4d+13), because the (d+1) part is coprime to d.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nIn general, if a and b are coprime, and a divides b*c, then a divides c.\n\nYes, that's a standard theorem.\n\nHere, d and (d+1) are coprime, and d divides [3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)], so d divides 3(d^2-4d+13) * (d+1), but since d and (d+1) coprime, yes, d divides 3(d^2-4d+13).\n\nMore precisely: d divides the product P = 3(d+1) Q, where Q = d^2-4d+13.\n\nSince d and (d+1) are coprime, and d divides P, then d must divide 3Q.\n\nYes.\n\nSo d divides 3(d^2-4d+13).\n\nNow, d divides 3(d^2-4d+13).\n\nBut d divides d^2-4d+13? No, d divides d^2 and 4d, so d divides d^2 -4d, so d divides [3(d^2-4d+13) - 3(d^2-4d)] = 3*13=39.\n\nLet me compute.\n\nLet R = d^2 -4d +13.\n\nd divides 3R.\n\nBut d divides d^2 -4d, since it's d(d-4), so d divides (R - 13) + something, wait.\n\nR - 13 = d^2 -4d, which is divisible by d.\n\nSo R \u2261 13 mod d.\n\nThus 3R \u2261 3*13 =39 mod d.\n\nAnd d divides 3R, so 3R \u22610 mod d, so 39 \u22610 mod d, so d|39.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no other possibilities.\n\nBut d divides 3R, and 3R \u226139 mod d, but since d divides 3R, exactly 3R = k d for some integer k, and 3R \u226139 mod d means 3R -39 is divisible by d, but since d divides 3R, it divides 39.\n\nYes.\n\nSo only possibilities are d|39, d>=3, so d=3,13,39.\n\nn=1,11,37.\n\nSum=1+11+37=49.\n\nThe problem says \"positive integers n\", and I think that's all.\n\nBut is n=1 positive integer? Yes.\n\nAnd we checked all work.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if d=1, but d=n+2>=3, since n>=1, d>=3, so d=1 is not possible, and d=1 divides everything, but n=d-2=-1, not positive.\n\nSimilarly, d=39's factors include negative, but we consider positive divisors.\n\n39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, all positive.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are other n where perhaps n+2 and the product have common factors in a different way, but I think the math covers it.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the condition is that n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nNow, n^2+9, perhaps factor or something, but n^2+9 = (n^2 -4 +13)= (n-2)^2 + something, wait earlier we had.\n\nSince n\u2261 -2 mod (n+2), so substitute n\u2261 -2 into the product.\n\nThat's similar to what I did.\n\nn \u2261 -2 mod (n+2), so 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \u2261 3(-2+3)((-2)^2 +9) = 3(1)(4+9)=3*1*13=39 mod (n+2).\n\nSame thing, so must be 0, so n+2 divides 39.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nSo the positive integers n are those with n+2 dividing 39, and n positive, so n+2 >=3, and divisors 3,13,39, so n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nSo the sum is 49.\n\nThe answer should be 49.\n\nThe problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I think that's it.\n\nPerhaps n=0, but n positive, so no.\n\nOr negative, but no.\n\nSo I think that's all.",
        "The problem is to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). I need to box my final answer.\n\nFirst, since it's about divisibility, I should consider the condition that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). That means when I divide \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) by \\( n+2 \\), there's no remainder.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use polynomial division or consider the expression modulo \\( n+2 \\).\n\nSet \\( d = n+2 \\), so n = d - 2. Then substitute into the product.\n\nSo, the product is \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nNow, d divides this product: \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nSince d divides this, and d is an integer (because n is positive integer, so d = n+2 is also integer greater than 2), so d | 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13).\n\nBut d and d+1 are coprime, so d must divide 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), but since d and d+1 are coprime, the divisibility by d depends on the other factors.\n\nSince d divides the product, and d is integer, we have that \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\) is divisible by d, so \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d} \\).\n\nModulo d, d \u2261 0, so this becomes 3(0+1)(0 - 0 + 13) = 3*1*13 = 39 \u2261 0 mod d, so d divides 39.\n\nIs that right?

No, the 3 is already in numerator.\n\nProduct is 3*40*1378, divide by 39=3*13.\n\nSo (3*40*1378) / (3*13) = (40*1378) / 13.\n\n1378 / 13 = 106, so 40*106=4240.\n\nYes, integer, so divisible.\n\nSo all three work: n=1,11,37.\n\nNow, sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut the problem asks for sum of all positive integers n, and I got 1,11,37, sum 49.\n\nEarlier I considered only d\u22653, divisors 3,13,39.\n\nBut d could be negative? No, n positive integer, d=n+2\u22653>0, so positive divisors.\n\nDivisors of 39 are \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139, but since d\u22653, only positive ones greater or equal 3.\n\nBut d=1? d=n+2\u22653>1, so not.\n\nIn the modulo calculation, I assumed d divides the product, and got d|39.\n\nBut is there a possibility that d does not divide 39, but still divides the product?\n\nFor example, if d and the other factors have common factors.\n\nIn the modulo calculation, I have that the product \u226139 mod d, so for it to be 0 mod d, d must divide 39.\n\nSince we're working modulo d, and the expression is exactly 39 modulo d, meaning the remainder is 39 when divided by d, but since d could be larger than 39, but if d>39, then 39 mod d =39 \u22600 unless d divides 39, but if d>39, it can't divide 39 unless 39=0, which is not.\n\nMore carefully: if d does not divide 39, then 39 mod d \u22600, so the product \u226139 \u22600 mod d, so not divisible.\n\nOnly when d divides 39, it could be zero.\n\nAnd we checked all such d\u22653, which are 3,13,39.\n\nBut d=1 is a divisor, but d\u22653, n\u22651, d\u22653.\n\nJust to be thorough, if n= -1, but n positive, so no.\n\nPerhaps d could be 1, but n= -1 not positive.\n\nOr d= -3, etc., but d=n+2\u22653>0.\n\nSo only three possibilities.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nThe problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I got 49.\n\nBut let me see if there are more.\n\nPerhaps I missed some divisors.\n\n39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, that's all.\n\nPositive ones.\n\nPerhaps n+2 could be 1, but n= -1 not positive.\n\nOr n+2= -1, n= -3, not positive.\n\nSo only three.\n\nPerhaps when d divides d+1 or something, but no, in the modulo, it's clear.\n\nAnother way to think: the condition is that n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nNow, n^2+9 = (n^2 -4) +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13? No.\n\nn^2 +9 divided by n+2.\n\nLet me do polynomial division.\n\nDivide n^2 +9 by n+2.\n\nn^2 +0n +9 divided by n+2.\n\nn^2 / n = n, n*(n+2)=n^2 +2n, subtract: (n^2 +0n +9) - (n^2 +2n) = -2n +9.\n\nThen -2n / n = -2, -2*(n+2)= -2n -4, subtract: (-2n +9) - (-2n -4) = 9+4=13.\n\nSo n^2 +9 = (n+2)(n-2) + 13? From division: quotient is n-2, remainder 13.\n\nI divided n^2 +0n +9 by n+2.\n\nFirst term n, n*(n+2)=n^2+2n, subtract from n^2+0n+9: (n^2+0n+9)-(n^2+2n)= -2n+9.\n\nThen -2n+9 divided by n+2: -2, -2*(n+2)= -2n-4, subtract: (-2n+9)-(-2n-4)=13.\n\nSo yes, n^2 +9 = (n+2)(n-2) + 13? Quotient is n-2? n and then -2, no.\n\nIn polynomial division, the quotient is n - 2? Let's see: (n+2)(n-2) = n^2 -4, then n^2 -4 +13 = n^2 +9, yes.\n\n(n+2)(n-2) = n^2 -4, and remainder 13, so n^2 +9 = (n+2)(n-2) + 13? n^2 +9 - (n^2 -4) =13, yes.\n\nEarlier I said n^2 +9 = (n+2)(n-2) +13, yes.\n\nBut n-2 is not the quotient in the sense, in division by n+2, quotient is n-2, remainder 13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo back to the product: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(n+3)[ (n+2)(n-2) + 13 ]\n\nWhen divided by n+2, the term (n+2)(n-2) is divisible, so the remainder comes from 3(n+3)*13, but it's a product.\n\nBetter to write:\n\n3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(n+3) [ (n+2)(n-2) + 13 ] = 3(n+3)(n+2)(n-2) + 39(n+3)\n\nNow, divide by n+2: the first term 3(n+3)(n+2)(n-2) is clearly divisible by n+2.\n\nThe second term is 39(n+3), so for the whole thing to be divisible by n+2, since the first part is already divisible, we need 39(n+3) to be divisible by n+2.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nIn polynomial sense, yes, but since we're dealing with integers, when we divide the integer value.\n\nFrom the expression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(n+3)(n+2)(n-2) + 39(n+3)\n\nSo, when divided by n+2, the quotient is 3(n+3)(n-2) plus the division of 39(n+3) by n+2, but for the remainder to be zero, since 3(n+3)(n+2)(n-2) is divisible, we need 39(n+3) to be divisible by n+2.\n\nIn integer division, yes.\n\nSo, n+2 divides 39(n+3).\n\nSince n+2 and n+3 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, gcd(n+2,n+3)=1.\n\nTherefore, since n+2 divides 39(n+3), and n+2 coprime to n+3, it must be that n+2 divides 39.\n\nExactly as I got earlier.\n\nSo, d = n+2 divides 39, and since gcd(d, n+3)=gcd(d, (n+2)+1)=gcd(d,1)=1, yes coprime, so d|39.\n\nSo same conclusion.\n\nThus, only possibilities are d=3,13,39, n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut is there any other divisor I missed? What about negative divisors? But d=n+2\u22653>0, so no.\n\nPerhaps d=1, but n=-1 not positive.\n\nOr d=39, already included.\n\nBut 39 has also divisor 1 and 13, already considered.\n\nPerhaps n+2 could be -3, but n=-5, not positive.\n\nSo, only three positive integers n.\n\nSum is 49.\n\nBut let me confirm the sum: 1+11=12, 12+37=49, yes.\n\nPerhaps the problem has more solutions if n+2 and n+3 are not coprime, but they are always coprime.\n\nUnless n+2 and n+3 share a common factor, but consecutive integers are always coprime.\n\nSo, no issue.\n\nPerhaps when n+2 divides 39, but also if n+2 divides the other part, but no, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\nFrom the expression, n+2 divides 39(n+3), and since gcd(n+2,n+3)=1, yes.\n\nEven if not coprime, but in this case they are.\n\nSo, I think that's all.\n\nSo, the sum is 49.\n\nBut the answer format says \"put your answer in \\boxed{}\", so probably \\boxed{49}.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something, because 49 is 7^2, and perhaps there are more n.\n\nPerhaps n= -3 or something, but not positive.\n\nOr n=0, but n positive integer, usually starts from 1.\n\nn=1 is included.\n\nPerhaps check n=2.\n\nn=2, d=4, does 4 divide 3(5)(4+9)=3*5*13=195? 195 /4=48.75, not integer, and 4 does not divide 39, since 39/4=9.75, not integer.\n\nSimilarly, n=3, d=5, product 3(6)(9+9)=3*6*18=324, 324/5=64.8, not integer, and 5 does not divide 39.\n\nn=12, d=14, 14 does not divide 39, product 3(15)(144+9)=3*15*153=45*153, 153/3=51, wait, but 14 divides? 45*153=6885, 6885 /14=491.785..., not integer.\n\n14*492=6888, too big, 14*491=6874, 6885-6874=11, not zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, only those three.\n\nPerhaps d= -13, but n= -15, not positive.\n\nSo, I think that's all.\n\nSo, the sum is 49.",
        "I need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). And then box the answer.\n\nFirst, since it's about divisibility, I should work with the condition that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). That means when I divide \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) by \\( n+2 \\), there's no remainder.\n\nI recall that for polynomials, if a linear factor divides a polynomial, then the root makes the polynomial zero. But here, \\( n+2 \\) is a linear term, and the product is also a polynomial in n, so I can consider the polynomial division or use the factor theorem.\n\nLet me denote the product as P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nI need P(n) to be divisible by n+2.\n\nBy the factor theorem, if n+2 divides P(n), then P(-2) should be zero. But P(-2) = 3(-2+3)((-2)^2+9) = 3(1)(4+9) = 3*1*13 = 39, which is not zero. So n+2 is not a factor of P(n) in the polynomial sense, but since n is integer, it might still divide for specific n.\n\nI should consider the division algorithm or modular arithmetic.\n\nSince n+2 divides P(n), that means P(n) \u2261 0 mod (n+2).\n\nBut n \u2261 -2 mod (n+2), so I can substitute n = -2 into P(n), but as I did earlier, P(-2) = 39, and for n+2 to divide P(n), P(n) must be congruent to P(-2) modulo n+2, which is 39 mod (n+2), and this should be 0, so n+2 divides 39.\n\nIf n \u2261 -2 mod (n+2), then P(n) \u2261 P(-2) mod (n+2), yes, because P is a polynomial.\n\nP(n) is a polynomial, so yes, P(n) - P(-2) is divisible by n - (-2) = n+2, so P(n) \u2261 P(-2) mod (n+2).\n\nAnd P(-2) = 39, as calculated.\n\nSo P(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2).\n\nFor n+2 to divide P(n), we need P(n) \u2261 0 mod (n+2), so 39 \u2261 0 mod (n+2), which means n+2 divides 39.\n\nOh, so the condition simplifies to n+2 divides 39.\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, because P(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2), so for divisibility, 39 must be divisible by n+2.\n\nSo n+2 is a divisor of 39.\n\nAnd n is a positive integer, so n+2 is a positive divisor greater than 2, since n\u22651, n+2\u22653.\n\nn is positive integer, so n\u22651, n+2\u22653.\n\nNow, 39's positive divisors are 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut n+2\u22653, so possible n+2 are 3,13,39.\n\nDivisors are 1,3,13,39, yes.\n\nn+2\u22653, so 3,13,39.\n\nNow, corresponding n: if n+2=3, n=1.\n\nIf n+2=13, n=11.\n\nIf n+2=39, n=37.\n\nNow, I need to check if these satisfy the original condition.\n\nAccording to this, they should, but let me verify.\n\nFirst, n=1: n+2=3.\n\nP(n)=3(n+3)(n^2+9)=3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120.\n\n120 divided by 3 is 40, yes, divisible.\n\nn=11: n+2=13.\n\nP(11)=3(11+3)(121+9)=3*14*130.\n\n121+9=130, yes.\n\n3*14=42, 42*130.\n\nOr 3*14*130=3*14=42, 42*130=42*100 + 42*30=4200+1260=5460? Better: 14*130=1820, then 3*1820=5460.\n\nNow, divide by 13: 5460 / 13.\n\n13*420=5460, yes, exactly.\n\nn=37: n+2=39.\n\nP(37)=3(37+3)(37^2+9)=3*40*(1369+9)=3*40*1378.\n\n37^2=1369, yes.\n\nNow, 3*40=120, 120*1378.\n\nBut need to divide by 39.\n\nSince n+2=39, and P(n) should be divisible by 39.\n\nCompute P(37)/39.\n\nP(37)=3*40*1378.\n\n1378 / 39? 39*35=1365, 1378-1365=13, not integer? No.\n\nP(37)=3*(40)* (1378)\n\nBut 1378 divided by 39.\n\n39*35=1365, as I said, 1378-1365=13, so 1378 = 39*35 + 13, not divisible.\n\nBut P(37)=3*40*1378, so let's compute the whole thing.\n\nP(n)=3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nFor n=37, n+3=40, n^2+9=1369+9=1378.\n\nSo 3*40*1378.\n\nNow, n+2=39.\n\nDoes 39 divide 3*40*1378?\n\n3*40*1378 / 39.\n\nFirst, 39=3*13, so divide by 3 and by 13.\n\nAlready have a 3, so 3/3=1, now 40*1378 / 13.\n\n1378 / 13.\n\n13*106=1378, yes, 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378.\n\nSo 1378 / 13 = 106.\n\nThen 40 * 106 = 4240.\n\nAnd we had divided by 3 already, no: P(n)/ (n+2) = [3*40*1378] / 39.\n\n39=3*13, and 1378=13*106, so [3*40*13*106] / (3*13) = 40*106 = 4240, integer, yes.\n\nI forgot that there's a 3 in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo yes, it works.\n\nNow, are there negative divisors? I considered only positive divisors, but n is positive integer, n+2 is positive, so divisors should be positive.\n\n39 has negative divisors: -1,-3,-13,-39.\n\nBut n+2 is positive since n\u22651, n+2\u22653>0, so only positive divisors.\n\nSo n+2 could be 1, but n+2=1 implies n=-1, not positive integer.\n\nSimilarly, n+2=3,13,39 are the only possibilities.\n\nEarlier I listed divisors 1,3,13,39, and excluded 1.\n\nBut is there any other divisor? 39 has divisors \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139.\n\nPositive are 1,3,13,39.\n\nn+2\u22653, so 3,13,39.\n\nn=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nThe problem asks for sum of all such positive integers n.\n\nIs that all?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nIn the beginning, I assumed that P(n) \u2261 P(-2) mod (n+2), and set it to zero.\n\nBut P(n) is defined, and n+2 divides P(n), so yes.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps when n+2 divides 39, but maybe there are cases where n+2 does not divide 39, but still divides P(n), but according to the polynomial congruence, it should be necessary and sufficient.\n\nIs it sufficient? In this case, since P(n) - 39 is divisible by n+2, so if n+2 divides 39, then it divides P(n) - 39 + 39, wait no.\n\nP(n) - P(-2) is divisible by n+2, since P is polynomial.\n\nP(n) - P(-2) is divisible by n - (-2) = n+2.\n\nYes, so P(n) = (n+2) Q(n) + P(-2) for some polynomial Q.\n\nSo P(n) = (n+2) Q(n) + 39.\n\nTherefore, for integer n, P(n) - 39 is divisible by n+2, so P(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2).\n\nThus, n+2 divides P(n) iff n+2 divides 39.\n\nSo yes, necessary and sufficient.\n\nTherefore, only when n+2 divides 39.\n\nAnd for positive n, n+2=3,13,39, n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut is n+2=1 possible? n=-1, not positive.\n\nWhat about other divisors? 39 has divisor 39,13,3,1, and that's all.\n\nPositive divisors.\n\nBut let me check if n+2 could be negative divisor, but n+2\u22653>0, so no.\n\nPerhaps n+2= -3, but n+2=-3, n=-5, not positive.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo only three possibilities.\n\nBut the sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nThe problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I think that's it.\n\nBut let me double-check with another value.\n\nSuppose n+2=1, n=-1, P(-1)=3(-1+3)(1+9)=3*2*10=60, 60 divided by 1 is 60, but n not positive.\n\nSimilarly, if n+2= -13, n=-15, P(-15)=3(-15+3)(225+9)=3*(-12)*234= negative, but divisible? But n not positive.\n\nSo only positive n.\n\nIn the product, there is n^2+9, which is always positive, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if n+2 divides the product, and maybe some cases where denominator is zero, but n+2=0 when n=-2, but division by zero, but n positive, so no issue.\n\nSo I think that's all.\n\nBut the answer seems straightforward, but perhaps I missed some divisors.\n\n39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, yes.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that n+2 could be a divisor, but in the product, there might be common factors.\n\nAnother way to think: let d = n+2, then n = d-2.\n\nThen P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 +9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +4 +9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13)\n\nNow, d divides 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13)\n\nSince d divides d, and the product is 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13), so when we divide by d, it's 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13)/d.\n\nFor this to be integer, since d divides the product, and d may share factors with the other terms.\n\nBut from earlier, since P(n) = 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13), and n+2=d, so d divides 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13).\n\nNow, d divides this product.\n\nIf d and d+1 are coprime, which they are, since consecutive integers.\n\nd and d+1 are always coprime.\n\nd may share factors with d^2 -4d +13.\n\nd^2 -4d +13 modulo d: when d divides d, d^2 \u22610, -4d\u22610, so d^2 -4d +13 \u226113 mod d.\n\nSimilarly, d+1 \u22611 mod d.\n\nSo the product 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \u2261 3*1*13 =39 mod d.\n\nAgain, same as before, so d divides 39.\n\nSo confirms.\n\nThus, d|n+2 divides 39.\n\nSo d is a positive divisor of 39 greater than or equal to 3.\n\nSo d=3,13,39.\n\nn=d-2=1,11,37.\n\nSum=1+11+37=49.\n\nNow, the answer should be 49.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I think that's it.\n\nPerhaps n= -3 or something, but no.\n\nOr maybe when n+2=0, but undefined.\n\nPerhaps I should list all positive divisors including smaller ones, but n+2=1, n=-1 not positive.\n\nIs there a divisor I missed? 39 has 3,13,39, and 1, but 1 is out.\n\nPerhaps negative, but no.\n\nAnother thought: when I computed P(-2)=39, and n+2 divides 39, but for n integer, yes.\n\nPerhaps there are cases where n+2 does not divide 39, but due to some cancellation, but no, because the congruence must hold.\n\nFor example, suppose n+2=2, but 2 does not divide 39, n=0, but n=0 not positive, but let's check P(0)=3(3)(9)=81, 81 / 2 =40.5, not integer, yes.\n\nn=2, n+2=4, 4 divides 39? no, P(2)=3(5)(4+9)=3*5*13=195, 195 /4=48.75, not integer.\n\nn=3, n+2=5, 5 divides 39? no, P(3)=3(6)(9+9)=3*6*18=324, 324/5=64.8, no.\n\nn=10, n+2=12, 12 divides 39? no, P(10)=3(13)(100+9)=3*13*109= about 4000 something, divided by 12, not necessarily, but 109*39= let's not compute, but shouldn't be divisible.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, only three values.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nSo the answer should be 49.\n\nBut let me confirm the sum: 1+11=12, 12+37=49, yes.\n\nPerhaps the problem has more, or perhaps I need to include n where n+2 divides, but maybe when n+2 and the product have common factors.\n\nAnother way: perhaps factor the product.\n\nP(n)=3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nn^2+9, can it be factored? Over integers, no, it's always positive.\n\nBut perhaps I can write the condition as (n+2) divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nSince n+2 and n+3 are consecutive, coprime, so n+2 and n+3 share no common factors.\n\nn+2 and n^2+9: let me see the gcd.\n\nCompute n^2+9 mod n+2.\n\nn\u2261-2 mod n+2, so (-2)^2 +9=4+9=13, so n^2+9 \u226113 mod n+2.\n\nSimilarly, as before.\n\nSo unless n+2 divides 13 or something, but already covered.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sum is 49.\n\nNow, the answer is 49.\n\nBut the problem says \"Answer: Please put your answer in \\boxed{}.\"\n\nSo I should box it.\n\nBut in the initial, it says \"Answer:\" and then box.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it.\n\nSo, the sum is 49.",
        "The problem is to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). I need to box my final answer.\n\nFirst, since it's about divisibility, I should look at the expression and see when \\( n+2 \\) divides that product. Let me denote the product as \\( p = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). So, \\( n+2 \\) divides p.\n\nSince \\( n+2 \\) is a linear term, I can consider the division of p by \\( n+2 \\) and set the remainder to zero.\n\nI can write that \\( \\frac{3(n+3)(n^2+9)}{n+2} \\) should be an integer.\n\nLet me simplify this expression. Notice that \\( n^2 + 9 \\) can be factored or maybe polynomial division would help.\n\nLet me try polynomial division of \\( n^2 + 9 \\) by \\( n+2 \\).\n\nDividing \\( n^2 + 0n + 9 \\) by \\( n+2 \\):\n\nn+2 into n^2: n, times n+2 is n^2 + 2n, subtract: (n^2 + 0n + 9) - (n^2 + 2n) = -2n + 9.\n\nThen, n+2 into -2n + 9: -2, times n+2 is -2n -4, subtract: (-2n + 9) - (-2n -4) = 13.\n\nSo, \\( n^2 + 9 = (n+2)(n-2) + 13 \\)? Let me check:\n\n(n+2)(n-2) = n^2 - 4, plus 13 is n^2 + 9, yes.\n\nFrom division: quotient is n - 2, remainder 13? Let's see:\n\nI had: divided n^2 +0n +9 by n+2.\n\nFirst term: n, n*(n+2)=n^2+2n, subtract from n^2+0n+9: (n^2+0n+9)-(n^2+2n)= -2n+9.\n\nThen, -2n+9 divided by n+2: -2, -2*(n+2)= -2n-4, subtract: (-2n+9)-(-2n-4)=13.\n\nSo yes, \\( n^2 + 9 = (n+2)(n-2) + 13 \\)? No:\n\nQuotient is n - 2? When I did n times, I got quotient n for n^2, but then after subtracting, I have -2n+9, which is linear, so quotient should be n - 2? Let's compute (n+2)(n-2) = n^2 - 4, and n^2 -4 +13 = n^2 +9, yes, so \\( n^2 +9 = (n+2)(n-2) + 13 \\).\n\nRemainder is 13, which is constant.\n\nIn polynomial division, it's \\( n^2 +9 = (n+2) \\cdot q(n) + r \\), and I found q(n) = n-2, r=13.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to the product: p = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(n+3)[ (n+2)(n-2) + 13 ]\n\nSo, p = 3(n+3)(n+2)(n-2) + 3(n+3)*13\n\n= 3(n+2)(n+3)(n-2) + 39(n+3)\n\nNow, I need n+2 to divide p, so p / (n+2) should be integer.\n\nFrom above, p = 3(n+2)(n+3)(n-2) + 39(n+3)\n\nSo, when I divide by n+2, the first term is integer if n is integer, but since we're dealing with integers, n+2 could be zero, but n is positive integer, so n+2 \u22653, not zero, so division is fine in rationals, but we need integer division.\n\nBetter to write:\n\np / (n+2) = [3(n+2)(n+3)(n-2) + 39(n+3)] / (n+2) = 3(n+3)(n-2) + 39(n+3)/(n+2)\n\nSince the first part is integer when n integer, the whole thing is integer if and only if 39(n+3)/(n+2) is integer.\n\nIs that right? p / (n+2) = 3(n+3)(n-2) + 39(n+3)/(n+2)\n\nYes, and 3(n+3)(n-2) is certainly integer for integer n, so for p/(n+2) to be integer, we need 39(n+3)/(n+2) to be integer.\n\nIs that correct? Let me see.\n\np / (n+2) = 3(n+3)(n-2) + \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2}\n\nFor this to be integer, since 3(n+3)(n-2) is integer, yes, \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} must be integer.\n\nSo, let me denote d = n+2, then n = d - 2, so n+3 = (d-2)+3 = d+1.\n\nSo, \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} = \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} = 39 (1 + \\frac{1}{d}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{d}\n\nBetter: \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} = \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} = 39 (1 + \\frac{1}{d}) no, \\frac{d+1}{d} = 1 + \\frac{1}{d}, yes.\n\nBut in terms of fraction, \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d}, and for this to be integer, since d is integer (as n integer, d=n+2 integer), \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} must be integer.\n\n\\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot (d+1) / d, so d must divide 39(d+1).\n\nBut d and d+1 are coprime, so d divides 39.\n\nIs that right? Yes, because if d divides 39(d+1), and gcd(d, d+1)=1, so d divides 39.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSince d and d+1 are coprime, d | 39(d+1) implies d | 39.\n\nSimilarly, from \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\frac{d+1}{d}, and for this to be integer, \\frac{d+1}{d} = 1 + \\frac{1}{d}, so 1 + \\frac{1}{d} must be such that when multiplied by 39, it's integer, but since 39 is integer, \\frac{39}{d} must be integer because 1 is integer, so \\frac{39}{d} integer, so d divides 39.\n\nFrom \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = \\frac{39d + 39}{d} = 39 + \\frac{39}{d}, so indeed, for this to be integer, \\frac{39}{d} must be integer, so d divides 39.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, d = n+2 divides 39.\n\nAnd d is positive since n positive integer, n \u22651, so d = n+2 \u22653.\n\nn is positive integer, so n\u22651, d\u22653.\n\nNow, 39's positive divisors are 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut d\u22653, so possible d: 3,13,39.\n\nNow, d divides 39, and d\u22653, so d=3,13,39.\n\nNow, recall that we have \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} must be integer, which we ensured by d|n+2 divides 39.\n\nBut in the earlier step, we have p/(n+2) = 3(n+3)(n-2) + \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2}, and both parts need to be such that the sum is integer, but since 3(n+3)(n-2) is always integer for integer n, and \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} is integer when d|n+2 divides 39, so yes.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nWe also have the condition that n is positive integer, and d=n+2.\n\nNow, for each d=3,13,39, find n.\n\nd=n+2, so n=d-2.\n\nFor d=3, n=3-2=1.\n\nFor d=13, n=13-2=11.\n\nFor d=39, n=39-2=37.\n\nNow, I need to check if these satisfy the original condition.\n\nIn the derivation, I assumed n+2 \u22600, which is fine, and I think it should work.\n\nBut let me verify.\n\nFirst, n=1.\n\nThen n+2=3.\n\nProduct p=3(n+3)(n^2+9)=3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120.\n\n120 divided by 3 is 40, integer, yes.\n\nSecond, n=11.\n\nn+2=13.\n\np=3(11+3)(11^2+9)=3*14*(121+9)=3*14*130.\n\nCompute: 121+9=130, yes.\n\n3*14=42, 42*130.\n\n130/13=10, but wait, divide by n+2=13.\n\np=3*14*130.\n\n14=2*7, 130=13*10, so p=3*2*7*13*10.\n\nSo divided by 13 is 3*2*7*10=420, integer, yes.\n\nThird, n=37.\n\nn+2=39.\n\np=3(37+3)(37^2+9)=3*40*(1369+9)=3*40*1378.\n\nNow, divide by 39.\n\n39=3*13, p=3*40*1378.\n\n1378 divided by 13? 13*106=1378, yes, because 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378.\n\nSo p=3*40*1378=3*40*13*106.\n\nBetter: p=3*40*1378, and 1378=13*106, so p=3*40*13*106.\n\nDivide by n+2=39=3*13.\n\nSo p / 39 = (3*40*13*106) / (3*13) = 40*106=4240, integer, yes.\n\nNow, are there any other divisors? Earlier I listed positive divisors of 39: 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut d\u22653, so excluded 1.\n\nWhat if d=1? n+2=1, n=-1, but n is positive integer, so not considered.\n\nAre there negative divisors? But n positive, d=n+2>0, so only positive.\n\nIn the divisors, I have only these three.\n\nThe problem asks for sum of all such positive integers n.\n\nSo n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nIs that all?\n\nEarlier I assumed that d divides 39, but let me double-check if there are other possibilities.\n\nIn the expression, \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} must be integer.\n\nAnd since n+2 and n+3 are consecutive integers, almost, n+3 = (n+2) +1, so yes, gcd(n+2, n+3)=1, so indeed, n+2 must divide 39.\n\nIn my earlier step, I set d=n+2, then \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} must be integer, and since d and d+1 coprime, d|39.\n\nYes.\n\n\\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{n+3}{n+2}.\n\nAnd \\frac{n+3}{n+2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{n+2}, so 39(1 + \\frac{1}{n+2}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{n+2}, so yes, \\frac{39}{n+2} must be integer.\n\nSo n+2 must be a positive divisor of 39, and since n\u22651, n+2\u22653, so divisors 3,13,39.\n\nBut 39 has also negative divisors, but n+2 positive, so no.\n\nAnd 1, but n+2=1 implies n=-1, not positive.\n\nSo only three possibilities.\n\nSum is 1+11+37.\n\n1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nThe answer should be 49.\n\nThe problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I got 49.\n\nI could check if there are other n where perhaps n+2 divides the product even if not dividing 39, but from the algebra, it seems necessary.\n\nSuppose n+2 does not divide 39, but perhaps the fractional part cancels with something, but in this case, since the other term is integer, no.\n\nFor example, suppose n+2=2, but n=0, not positive.\n\nOr n+2=4, say, n=2.\n\nLet me check n=2.\n\nn=2, positive integer.\n\nn+2=4.\n\np=3(2+3)(4+9)=3*5*13=195.\n\n195 / 4 = 48.75, not integer, indeed, and 4 does not divide 39.\n\nAnother one, say n=3, n+2=5.\n\np=3(6)(9+9)=3*6*18=324.\n\n324 / 5 = 64.8, not integer.\n\nAnd 5 does not divide 39.\n\nNow, what about larger n, say n=37, we did.\n\nOr n=11.\n\nIs there any other divisor I missed? 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, that's all.\n\nPositive.\n\nSo, n=1,11,37.\n\nSum=1+11+37=49.\n\nBut 1+11=12, 12+37=49, yes.\n\nPerhaps n+2 could be -3,-13,etc, but n positive, n+2\u22653>0, so no.\n\nOr if n+2= -1, but negative, n=-3, not positive.\n\nSo, only these three.\n\nTherefore, sum is 49.\n\nThe answer should be 49.\n\nThe problem says \"find the sum\", and I think that's it.\n\nPerhaps I should write it in box.\n\nBut let me see the original product: 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nAnd n+2 divides it.\n\nAnother way to think: since n^2+9 = (n^2-4) +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13, as I did.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo, the sum is 49.",
        "The problem is to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). I need to box my final answer.\n\nFirst, since it's about divisibility, I should consider the condition that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). That means when I divide \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) by \\( n+2 \\), there's no remainder.\n\nI recall that for polynomials, if a linear factor divides a polynomial, then the root makes the polynomial zero. But here, \\( n+2 \\) is a linear term, and the product is also in terms of n, so I can think of this as a polynomial division.\n\nSet \\( d = n + 2 \\), so n = d - 2. Then substitute into the product.\n\nSo, the product is \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nNow, d divides this product: \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nSince d divides this, and d is an integer (because n is positive integer, so d = n+2 is also integer greater than 2), so d | 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13).\n\nBut d and d+1 are coprime, so d must divide 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), but since d and d+1 are coprime, the divisibility condition simplifies.\n\nActually, since d divides the product, and d is integer, we have that \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\) is divisible by d, so \\( \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)}{d} \\) must be integer.\n\nWhich is \\( 3(d+1) \\cdot \\frac{d^2 - 4d + 13}{d} = 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) \\).\n\nBetter to write:\n\n\\( \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)}{d} = 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) = 3(d+1)(d - 4) + 3(d+1) \\frac{13}{d} \\).\n\nFor this to be integer, since 3(d+1)(d-4) is already integer (as d is integer), the term \\( 3(d+1) \\frac{13}{d} \\) must be integer.

Let me check.\n\nIf d divides 39, then \\( \\frac{39}{d} \\) is integer, so \\( \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\frac{d+1}{d} \\) is integer, so the whole expression is integer, meaning that d divides the product.\n\nIs that correct? In the divisibility, we have that the quotient is integer, so yes, if d | 39, then the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut is that all? d = n+2, and n is positive integer, so d >= 3.\n\nAnd d divides 39, so possible d are the positive divisors of 39 greater than or equal to 3.\n\nDivisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39.\n\nSince d >=3, so d=3,13,39.\n\nNow, n = d - 2, so for d=3, n=1; d=13, n=11; d=39, n=37.\n\nNow, I need to check if these satisfy the original condition.\n\nEarlier I assumed that d and d+1 are coprime, which they are, and I concluded d must divide 39.\n\nBut let me verify with these values.\n\nFirst, n=1, d=3.\n\nProduct: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(4)(1+9)=3*4*10=120.\n\nn+2=3, 120 / 3 =40, integer, yes.\n\nn=11, d=13.\n\nProduct: 3(14)(121+9)=3*14*130.\n\n121+9=130, yes.\n\n3*14=42, 42*130=42*100 + 42*30=4200+1260=5460? Or 42*130=42*13*10=546*10=5460.\n\nn+2=13, 5460 / 13.\n\n13*420=5460, yes, integer.\n\nn=37, d=39.\n\nProduct: 3(40)(37^2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=120*1378.\n\n37^2=1369, yes.\n\n1378 * 120.\n\nBut divide by d=39.\n\nSo, 3(n+3)(n^2+9)/ (n+2) = 3(40)(1369+9)/39 = 3*40*1378 / 39.\n\n1378 / 39? 39*35=1365, 1378-1365=13, not integer? 1378 \u00f7 39.\n\n39*35=1365, 1378-1365=13, so 35 + 13/39, not integer, but we have whole thing.\n\n3*40*1378 / 39.\n\nNote that 1378 / 39 = 1378 \u00f7 13 / 3, 39=3*13, 1378 \u00f7 13.\n\n13*106=1378, yes, because 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378.\n\nSo 1378 / 13 = 106, and 39=3*13, so 1378 / 39 = 106 / 3.\n\n1378 / 39 = 1378 \u00f7 39.\n\nSince 39=3*13, and 1378 \u00f7 13 = 106, then 1378 / 39 = 106 / 3.\n\n106 / 3 is not integer, but we have 3*40 * (106 / 3) / something, let's write properly.\n\nThe quotient is 3(n+3)(n^2+9)/(n+2) = 3*40*1378 / 39.\n\nNow, 3*40*1378 / 39 = 120 * 1378 / 39.\n\nNow, 1378 / 39 = 1378 \u00f7 39.\n\nAs above, 39*35=1365, 1378-1365=13, so 35 + 13/39 = 35 + 1/3 = 106/3.\n\n1378 / 39 = 1378 \u00f7 13 / 39 \u00f7 13 = 106 / 3.\n\nYes, so 120 * (106 / 3) = 120 / 3 * 106 = 40 * 106 = 4240, which is integer.\n\nOh, so it works because the 3 in numerator cancels with the denominator.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, I forgot the 3 in the numerator.\n\nSo yes, it is integer.\n\nSo for d=39, it works.\n\nNow, are there more divisors? I have d=3,13,39.\n\nBut divisors of 39 are also negative, but since n positive integer, d=n+2>=3>0, so positive divisors.\n\nBut d=1 is a divisor, but d>=3, so excluded.\n\nd=1 corresponds to n=-1, not positive.\n\nSimilarly, other negative divisors would give negative n, not positive.\n\nSo only d=3,13,39, n=1,11,37.\n\nBut sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nThe problem asks for sum of all such positive integers n.\n\nIs that all?\n\nEarlier I assumed that d must divide 39, but is that necessary and sufficient?\n\nIn my derivation, I said that for the quotient to be integer, \\( \\frac{39}{d} \\) must be integer, so d|39.\n\nAnd I checked that for these d, it works.\n\nBut is there any other d that could work?\n\nSuppose d does not divide 39, but perhaps d and d+1 have common factors or something, but d and d+1 are always coprime, so no.\n\nPerhaps if d divides the other part.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFrom earlier, the condition is that \\( \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)}{d} \\) is integer.\n\nSince d and d+1 are coprime, d must divide 3(d^2-4d+13), but not necessarily, because the denominator is d, and numerator has d+1 and the quadratic.\n\nBetter to write it as:\n\n\\( \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)}{d} = 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) \\), so for this to be integer, since d-4 and d+1 are integers, the only issue is \\( \\frac{13}{d} \\) must be such that when multiplied by 3(d+1), it becomes integer.\n\nMore carefully: 3(d+1)(d-4) is integer, and 3(d+1) * (13/d), so 3(d+1) * 13 / d must be integer.\n\nSince d and d+1 coprime, the fraction 13 / d, but d could share factors with 3 or 13.\n\nActually, \\( \\frac{39 (d+1)}{d} \\) must be integer.\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} = 39 (1 + \\frac{1}{d}) - wait no, earlier.\n\n\\( \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d}{d} + 39 \\cdot \\frac{1}{d} = 39 + \\frac{39}{d} \\), no:\n\n\\( \\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} = 39 ( \\frac{d}{d} + \\frac{1}{d} ) = 39 (1 + \\frac{1}{d}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{d} \\), yes.\n\nSo indeed, \\( 39 + \\frac{39}{d} \\) must be integer, so \\( \\frac{39}{d} \\) must be integer, hence d divides 39.\n\nSo no other possibilities.\n\nBut d could be a divisor of 39, but I think that's all.\n\nPerhaps d=1, but n=-1 not positive.\n\nOr d=-3, etc., but not positive n.\n\nSo only three values: n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I got 49.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are more.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the polynomial division directly.\n\nLet me consider the expression 3(n+3)(n^2+9) divided by n+2.\n\nPerform polynomial division.\n\nConsider f(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nExpand it: first, (n+3)(n^2+9) = n(n^2+9) + 3(n^2+9) = n^3 + 9n + 3n^2 + 27 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 9n + 27.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81.\n\nNow, divide by n+2.\n\nSo, polynomial division of 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 by n+2.\n\nFirst, 3n^3 / n = 3n^2, multiply by n+2: 3n^2(n+2) = 3n^3 + 6n^2.\n\nSubtract: (3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81) - (3n^3 + 6n^2) = (9n^2 - 6n^2) + 27n + 81 = 3n^2 + 27n + 81.\n\nNext, 3n^2 / n = 3n, multiply by n+2: 3n(n+2) = 3n^2 + 6n.\n\nSubtract: (3n^2 + 27n + 81) - (3n^2 + 6n) = 21n + 81.\n\nNext, 21n / n = 21, multiply by n+2: 21(n+2) = 21n + 42.\n\nSubtract: (21n + 81) - (21n + 42) = 39.\n\nSo, the remainder is 39, and the quotient is 3n^2 + 3n + 21.\n\nFrom division: quotient is 3n^2 + 3n + 21, remainder 39.\n\nCheck: (n+2)(3n^2 + 3n + 21) = n(3n^2 + 3n + 21) + 2(3n^2 + 3n + 21) = 3n^3 + 3n^2 + 21n + 6n^2 + 6n + 42 = 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 42.\n\nBut earlier f(n) = 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81, so difference is 81 - 42 = 39, yes, so f(n) = (n+2)(3n^2 + 3n + 21) + 39.\n\nTherefore, f(n) / (n+2) = 3n^2 + 3n + 21 + 39 / (n+2).\n\nFor this to be integer, since n is integer, 3n^2 + 3n + 21 is integer, so 39 / (n+2) must be integer.\n\nHence, n+2 divides 39.\n\nExactly as I got earlier.\n\nSo n+2 | 39, and n positive integer, so n+2 >=3, and positive divisor.\n\nDivisors of 39: \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b113, \u00b139.\n\nPositive divisors: 1,3,13,39.\n\nn+2 >=3, so exclude 1.\n\nSo n+2 =3,13,39.\n\nn=1,11,37.\n\nSum=1+11+37=49.\n\nBut is n+2=1 possible? n=-1, not positive.\n\nOthers negative not positive.\n\nSo only three.\n\nBut the sum is 49.\n\nThe problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I think that's it.\n\nPerhaps n+2 could be negative divisors, but if n+2 negative, say n+2=-3, then n=-5, not positive.\n\nSimilarly, others negative, n negative, not considered.\n\nSo only positive n: 1,11,37.\n\nSum 49.\n\nBut let me confirm with another value.\n\nSuppose n+2=13, n=11, already did.\n\nOr is there any other divisor I missed? 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, that's all.\n\nPerhaps d= -1, but no.\n\nOr perhaps d=39/k or something, but no, d must divide 39.\n\nFrom the polynomial, it's clear.\n\nSo the sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut the answer should be boxed.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"find the sum\", and I got 49.\n\nPerhaps I should list them.\n\nAnother way: since n+2 divides 39, and n positive integer, n>=1, n+2>=3.\n\nPossible n+2=3,13,39, as above.\n\nIf n+2=1, n=-1, invalid.\n\nSo sum of n: 1,11,37.\n\nSum=49.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows n such that n+2 divides the product, and maybe when n+2 divides the remainder or something, but no, from the division, it's clear.\n\nPerhaps when the remainder is zero, but remainder is 39, which is constant, so only when n+2 divides 39.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think correct."

        "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Finally, we need to sum all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe condition is that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\\[ n+2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\]\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the Condition\nThe condition is about divisibility. To simplify, perhaps I can think of \\( n+2 \\) as a divisor of the expression. Let me denote \\( k = n + 2 \\). Then, \\( n = k - 2 \\).\n\nNow, rewrite the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\nFirst term inside the product: \\( n+3 = (k-2) + 3 = k + 1 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( n^2 + 9 = (k-2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 -4k +13 \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\]\n\nBut \\( n+2 = k \\), so the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) is already a factor in the denominator, but it's not explicitly in the numerator. Hmm, perhaps it's better to keep it as \\( n+2 \\mid \\text{expression} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Polynomial Division or Substitution\nI recall that if \\( n+2 \\) divides the polynomial \\( P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\), then by the Remainder Factor Theorem, \\( P(-2) \\) should be zero.\n\nBut \\( P(-2) \\) is:\n\\[ 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3 \\times 1 \\times 13 = 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\) means that when \\( n = -2 \\), the remainder is zero. But \\( P(-2) = 39 \\), not zero.\n\nWait, that's not correct. The Remainder Factor Theorem says that if \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\), then \\( P(-2) = 0 \\). But in our case, \\( P(-2) = 39 \\neq 0 \\).\n\nThis suggests that \\( n+2 \\) does not divide \\( P(n) \\) for all \\( n \\), but only for specific values.\n\nBut the problem is about finding specific positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Rewriting the Divisibility Condition\nGiven \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\), we can write:\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 0 \\mod (n+2) \\]\n\nBut working directly with this might be tricky. Instead, perhaps we can perform polynomial division or use substitution.\n\nLet me consider \\( n \\equiv -2 \\mod (n+2) \\). That is, in the expression \\( P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\), we can substitute \\( n \\) with \\( -2 \\) modulo \\( n+2 \\).\n\nBut \\( P(-2) = 39 \\), as calculated before.\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\) must divide \\( P(n) \\). So, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39, because \\( P(n) \\equiv P(-2) \\mod (n+2) \\), by the Remainder Factor Theorem.\n\nBut \\( P(n) \\mod (n+2) \\) is equivalent to \\( P(-2) \\), which is 39.\n\nTherefore, \\( n+2 \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\n### Step 4: Find Divisors of 39\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\) can also be negative divisors, but since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( n+2 \\) must be at least \\( 1+2=3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nBut \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\), and \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut we must also consider \\( n=0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nThus, \\( n+2 \\) must be a positive divisor of 39, and \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the smallest value is \\( n=1 \\) leading to \\( n+2=3 \\)).\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\), so possible values are: 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\) can also be negative divisors, but since \\( n \\) is positive, \\( n+2 \\) must be positive. So we only consider positive divisors.\n\nBut what if \\( n+2 \\) is negative? For example, if \\( n+2 = -3 \\), then \\( n = -5 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive. So, only positive divisors are relevant.\n\nBut, \\( n+2 \\) must be a positive divisor of 39, but \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 = 1 \\)? Then \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, only \\( n+2 \\) values of 3, 13, 39 are valid.\n\nBut, we must also consider \\( n+2 = 39 \\) (since 39 is a divisor).\n\nBut, what about \\( n+2 = 1 \\)? \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nFor \\( n+2 = 3 \\):\n\\[ n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\nFor \\( n+2 = 13 \\):\n\\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\]\n\nFor \\( n+2 = 39 \\):\n\\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\]\n\nBut, what about other divisors? The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut for \\( n+2 = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n\nFor \\( n+2 = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nFor \\( n+2 = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nFor \\( n+2 = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nBut, are there more? What about larger \\( n \\) values?\n\n### Verification\nBut, is it possible that for other \\( n \\) values, \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\) but \\( n+2 \\) is not a divisor of 39?\n\nAccording to the Remainder Factor Theorem, \\( P(n) \\mod (n+2) = P(-2) = 39 \\). Therefore, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39.\n\nThus, the only possible values for \\( n+2 \\) are the positive divisors of 39, which are 3, 13, 39 (since \\( n+2=1 \\) leads to negative \\( n \\)).\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but \\( P(n) \\) is divisible by \\( n+2 \\)?\n\nThe Remainder Factor Theorem tells us that \\( P(n) \\) modulo \\( (n+2) \\) is equal to \\( P(-2) \\), which is 39. Therefore, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39.\n\nThus, the only possible values for \\( n+2 \\) are the positive divisors of 39, as listed above.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's verify:\n\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n+2 = 3 \\]\n   \\[ P(n) = 3(1+3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\n   Now, check if 3 divides 120 \u2192 Yes, because 120/3 = 40.\n\n2. For \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n+2 = 13 \\]\n   \\[ P(n) = 3(11+3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\n   Now, 13 divides \\( P(n) \\) because 13 is a factor in 130 (since 130 = 13 \u00d7 10). So, 13 divides the product.\n\n3. For \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n+2 = 39 \\]\n   \\[ P(n) = 3(37+3)(37^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times (1369 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\]\n   Now, 39 divides \\( P(n) \\). To verify, we can check if 39 divides 1378 \u00d7 120 (since 3 \u00d7 40 = 120). But 39 = 3 \u00d7 13, so we need both 3 and 13 to divide the product.\n\n   - 3 is already present in the expression.\n   - For 13: 1378 \u00f7 13 \u2248 106 (since 13 \u00d7 106 = 1378? Let's check: 13 \u00d7 100 = 1300, plus 13 \u00d7 6 = 78 \u2192 1300 + 78 = 1378). So, 13 divides 1378.\n\nThus, all three cases satisfy the condition.\n\nBut, are there any other divisors? What about negative divisors?\n\nFor example, \\( n+2 = -3 \\) \u2192 \\( n = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values correspond to the positive divisors of 39 that are \u22653.\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but \\( P(n) \\) is divisible by \\( n+2 \\)?\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\n### General Approach\nThe condition is:\n\\[ n+2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\]\n\nLet's denote \\( d = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = d - 2 \\).\n\nSubstitute into the expression:\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(d - 2 + 3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d^2 -4d +4 +9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \\]\n\nThus, the condition becomes:\n\\[ d \\mid 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \\]\n\nBut \\( d \\) and \\( d+1 \\) are coprime, so \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\), but since \\( d \\) and \\( d+1 \\) are coprime, we can consider:\n\\[ d \\mid 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\]\n\nBut \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 \\) terms, but not necessarily the rest. Let's expand \\( 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\):\n\\[ 3d^2 -12d + 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( d \\) divides \\( 3d^2 -12d +39 \\). But \\( d \\) obviously divides \\( 3d^2 -12d \\), so \\( d \\) must divide the remaining term, which is 39.\n\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion.\n\n### Find All Positive Integers \\( n \\)\nGiven \\( d = n + 2 \\) must divide 39, and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( d \\geq 3 \\).\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( d \\geq 3 \\), so we consider \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nNow, find \\( n \\) for each \\( d \\):\n\n1. \\( d = 3 \\):\n   \\[ n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\n2. \\( d = 13 \\):\n   \\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\]\n\n3. \\( d = 39 \\):\n   \\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\]\n\nBut, what about \\( d = 1 \\)? It would give \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive.\n\nWhat about \\( d = -3, -13, -39 \\)? These would give negative \\( n \\) values, which are invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nBut, we must also consider if \\( d \\) is negative. However, since \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( n = d - 2 \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( d \\geq 3 \\). So, negative divisors are not relevant here.\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is a negative divisor? For example, \\( d = -3 \\):\n\\[ n = -3 - 2 = -5 \\] \u2192 invalid.\n\nThus, only positive divisors \\( d \\) such that \\( d \\geq 3 \\) are relevant.\n\nBut, is it possible that other \\( d \\) values work?\n\nLet me double-check. The condition was that \\( d \\) must divide 39. The complete list of divisors of 39 is: \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b113, \u00b139.\n\nBut since \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( d = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( d \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nThus, we consider \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but \\( d \\) divides the entire expression?\n\nLet me test \\( n = 4 \\), so \\( d = 6 \\).\n\nNow, \\( P(n) = 3(4+3)(4^2 +9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 525 \\).\n\nBut \\( d = 6 \\). Does 6 divide 525? 525 \u00f7 6 = 87.5 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only when \\( d \\) divides 39 does the condition hold.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps there are other \\( n \\) values where \\( d \\) doesn't necessarily divide 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\).\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe condition is \\( d \\mid 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( d \\) and \\( d+1 \\) are coprime, so \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 -4d \\) because \\( d \\) divides both \\( d^2 \\) and \\( 4d \\). So, \\( d \\) must divide the remaining part, which is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\), because:\n\\[ d^2 -4d +13 = (d^2 -4d) + 13 \\]\nBut \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 -4d \\), so \\( d \\) must divide 13, but we have a 3 multiplied in front.\n\nWait, no. The term is \\( 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\). Since \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 -4d \\), \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 13 \\), i.e., 39.\n\nThus, the only condition is that \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( d \\) values are the divisors of 39, and we've already considered all positive divisors \\( d \\geq 3 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe valid \\( n \\) values are obtained from \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\), giving \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is a larger divisor? Are there more?\n\nThe complete list of positive divisors of 39 is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\n- For \\( d=1 \\), \\( n=-1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( d=3 \\), \\( n=1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d=13 \\), \\( n=11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d=39 \\), \\( n=37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nAre there any other positive divisors? No, because 39 factors into 3 \u00d7 13, and its positive divisors are only 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nThus, the only valid positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's test \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive, so it's invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 2 \\), \\( d = 4 \\). Does 4 divide \\( P(2) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( P(2) = 3(2+3)(4 +9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\). Does 4 divide 195? 195 \u00f7 4 = 48.75 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n \\) values corresponding to \\( d \\) being a divisor of 39 work.\n\n### Verification of All Cases\nLet's verify all \\( n \\) values:\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n+2 = 3 \\]\n   \\[ P(n) = 3(4)(1+9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\n   \\[ 120 / 3 = 40 \\] \u2192 divisible.\n\n2. \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n+2 = 13 \\]\n   \\[ P(n) = 3(14)(121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\n   But 130 is divisible by 13 (since 13 \u00d7 10 = 130), so the whole expression is divisible by 13.\n\n3. \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n+2 = 39 \\]\n   \\[ P(n) = 3(40)(1369 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\]\n   Now, 39 = 3 \u00d7 13.\n   - The term has a 3, so divisible by 3.\n   - Now, check divisibility by 13: 1378 \u00f7 13 \u2248 106 (as before), and 106 \u00d7 13 = 1378. So, it's divisible by 13.\n   Thus, divisible by 39.\n\n### Are There More Solutions?\nAre there any other positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\)?\n\nSuppose \\( n+2 \\) is not a divisor of 39. Then, according to our earlier reasoning, \\( n+2 \\) would not divide \\( P(n) \\), because \\( d \\) must divide 39 for the condition to hold.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a multiple of a divisor of 39, but not necessarily a divisor itself? No, because the condition is strict: \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( n \\) values are those derived from the positive divisors of 39 that are \u22653.\n\n### Summing Up the Solutions\nThe valid \\( n \\) values are: 1, 11, 37.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all such positive integers \\( n \\):\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 1 + 11 = 12; 12 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, just to ensure completeness, perhaps we should check if there are any other divisors or cases we missed.\n\nWhat if \\( n+2 \\) is a non-trivial combination? For example, what if \\( n+2 \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\)?\n\nLet's suppose \\( n+2 \\) does not divide 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\).\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\\[ P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\]\n\nLet me expand \\( P(n) \\) to see if there's any hidden structure.\n\nFirst, expand \\( (n+3)(n^2+9) \\):\n\\[ (n+3)(n^2 +9) = n^3 + 9n + 3n^2 + 27 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 9n + 27 \\]\n\nNow multiply by 3:\n\\[ P(n) = 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 \\]\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division or use the Remainder Factor Theorem.\n\nThe condition is \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\). Let's perform polynomial division of \\( P(n) \\) by \\( n+2 \\), or use synthetic division.\n\nUsing the Remainder Factor Theorem, evaluate \\( P(-2) \\):\n\\[ P(-2) = 3(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 + 27(-2) + 81 = 3(-8) + 9(4) + 27(-2) + 81 \\]\n\\[ = -24 + 36 - 54 + 81 = (-24 + 36) = 12; (12 - 54) = -42; (-42 + 81) = 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( P(-2) = 39 \\), which means that \\( P(n) = (n+2)Q(n) + 39 \\), where \\( Q(n) \\) is the quotient polynomial.\n\nFor \\( n+2 \\) to divide \\( P(n) \\), it must divide the remainder term, which is 39. Therefore, \\( n+2 \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThus, the only positive integers \\( n \\) for which \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\) are those where \\( n+2 \\) is a positive divisor of 39 greater than or equal to 3.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( n+2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nThus, we consider \\( n+2 = 3, 13, 39 \\), leading to \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\\[ 1 + 11 = 12 \\]\n\\[ 12 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a larger number? For example, if \\( n+2 = 39 \\times k \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive, and \\( n+2 = d \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut 39's divisors are only 1, 3, 13, 39. So, no other possibilities.\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a multiple of 39? For example, \\( n+2 = 78 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 76 \\).\n\nLet's test \\( n = 76 \\):\n\\[ n+2 = 78 \\]\nNow, \\( P(76) = 3(76+3)(76^2 +9) \\). But 78 does not divide 39, so according to our earlier reasoning, 78 should not divide \\( P(76) \\).\n\nBut, does 78 divide \\( P(76) \\)?\n\nFirst, compute \\( n+3 = 79 \\), and \\( n^2 +9 = 76^2 +9 = 5776 +9 = 5785 \\).\n\nThus, \\( P(76) = 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\).\n\nNow, 78 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13.\n\nWe know \\( P(76) \\) has a factor of 3, but we need to check divisibility by 78.\n\nBut 79 is not divisible by any part of 78, and 5785 \u00f7 13 \u2248 445 (since 13 \u00d7 445 = 13 \u00d7 400 = 5200, plus 13 \u00d7 45 = 585 \u2192 5200 + 585 = 5785). So, 13 divides 5785.\n\nThus, \\( P(76) = 3 \\times 79 \\times (13 \\times 445) = 3 \\times 13 \\times 79 \\times 445 \\).\n\nBut 78 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13. So, \\( P(76) \\) has factors of 3 and 13, but does it have a factor of 2?\n\nCompute \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\). The term 5785 is odd (ends with 5), 79 is odd, and 3 is odd. So, the product is odd and not divisible by 2.\n\nThus, 78 does not divide \\( P(76) \\).\n\nThis confirms that only when \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39 does the condition hold.\n\nBut, in our initial analysis, we concluded that \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39. The example with \\( n+2 = 78 \\) shows that if \\( n+2 \\) does not divide 39, then \\( n+2 \\) does not divide \\( P(n) \\).\n\nBut, 78 is a multiple of 39, but \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39, not necessarily be equal to 39.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39, not necessarily be equal to 39.\n\nBut in the case of \\( n+2 = 78 \\), which is a multiple of 39, we saw that \\( P(n) \\) is not divisible by 78, because it's missing the factor of 2.\n\nBut 39 is \\( 3 \\times 13 \\), and 78 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\). The issue is the extra factor of 2 in 78.\n\nBut \\( P(n) \\) in this case is odd, so it's not divisible by 2, hence not divisible by 78.\n\nThus, only the exact divisors of 39 work, not their multiples.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are those where \\( n+2 \\) is exactly a divisor of 39, not a multiple.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( n \\) values are from \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\), giving \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 = 1 \\)? Then \\( n = -1 \\), which is invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n+2 = -3 \\), \\( n = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is it possible that there are other divisors? Let's think about \\( d \\) values that are not necessarily divisors of 39 but still satisfy the original condition.\n\nSuppose \\( d \\) does not divide 39, but \\( d \\) divides \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \\).\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe it's easier to stick with the earlier conclusion.\n\nFrom the Remainder Factor Theorem, we saw that \\( P(-2) = 39 \\), and thus \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, is this always true? What if \\( d \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\)?\n\nLet me think about this. The Remainder Factor Theorem tells us that:\n\\[ P(n) = (n+2)Q(n) + 39 \\]\n\nThus, for \\( d = n+2 \\) to divide \\( P(n) \\), it must divide the remainder, which is 39.\n\nTherefore, \\( d \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThis is a crucial point. The remainder when \\( P(n) \\) is divided by \\( n+2 \\) is 39. Therefore, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39 for \\( n+2 \\) to divide \\( P(n) \\).\n\nThus, the only possible values for \\( n+2 \\) are the divisors of 39.\n\nTherefore, the only positive integer solutions for \\( n \\) are obtained from the positive divisors of 39 that are \u22653.\n\nThus, \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, 37.\n\n### Summing Up\nNow, sum these values:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this all? What if \\( n+2 \\) is a non-trivial divisor?\n\nLet me double-check by considering all positive divisors of 39 and ensuring no other cases exist.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\n- For \\( d=1 \\), \\( n=-1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( d=3 \\), \\( n=1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d=13 \\), \\( n=11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d=39 \\), \\( n=37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nNo other positive divisors exist for 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a multiple of 39, like 78? We saw that for \\( n=76 \\), \\( n+2=78 \\), but \\( P(76) \\) was not divisible by 78.\n\nBut according to our reasoning, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39, not its multiples.\n\nBut, in the case of \\( d=78 \\), which is a multiple of 39, does it work?\n\nWe saw that \\( P(76) \\) is not divisible by 78, because although it's divisible by 3 and 13, it's not divisible by 2.\n\nBut, according to our earlier conclusion, \\( d \\) must divide 39. Since 78 does not divide 39, it shouldn't work, and indeed it doesn't.\n\nThus, our conclusion holds.\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39 in the negative sense?\n\nFor example, \\( d = -3 \\), \\( n = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a larger number that's not a multiple of 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\)?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 4 \\), \\( d = 6 \\). Does 6 divide \\( P(4) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( P(4) = 3(4+3)(4^2 +9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times (16 +9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 525 \\).\n\nNow, does 6 divide 525? 525 \u00f7 6 = 87.5 \u2192 No.\n\nAnother example, \\( n = 5 \\), \\( d = 7 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(5) = 3(8)(25 +9) = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 3 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 34.\n\nNow, 7 divides 3 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 34?\n\nFirst, 7 doesn't divide 3 or 8. Does 7 divide 34? 34 \u00f7 7 \u2248 4.857 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only the cases where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39 work.\n\nBut, in the case of \\( n=1 \\), \\( d=3 \\), and 3 divides 39, so it works.\n\nThus, our initial conclusion seems correct.\n\nBut, is it possible that for some \\( n \\), \\( n+2 \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\)?\n\nLet's suppose \\( n+2 \\) does not divide 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\).\n\nFrom the polynomial division perspective, we have:\n\\[ P(n) = (n+2)Q(n) + 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39 for \\( P(n) \\) to be divisible by \\( n+2 \\), unless there's some cancellation in \\( Q(n) \\), but since \\( Q(n) \\) is a polynomial, it's not immediately clear.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to stick with the cases where \\( n+2 \\) divides 39.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider \\( n = 10 \\), \\( d = 12 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(10) = 3(13)(100 +9) = 3 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 109.\n\nDoes 12 divide \\( 3 \\times 13 \\times 109 \\)?\n\nFirst, 3 is present, so we need another factor of 4 (since 12 = 3 \u00d7 4).\n\nBut 13 \u00d7 109 is odd \u00d7 odd = odd, and 3 \u00d7 odd is still odd. So, no factor of 4 \u2192 not divisible by 12.\n\nAnother example, \\( n = 7 \\), \\( d = 9 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(7) = 3(10)(49 +9) = 3 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 58.\n\nDoes 9 divide \\( 3 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 58 \\)?\n\nTotal is \\( 3 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 58 = 3 \u00d7 580 = 1740 \\). Now, 1740 \u00f7 9 \u2248 193.333... \u2192 Not divisible.\n\nThus, it seems that only when \\( n+2 \\) divides 39 does the condition hold.\n\nBut, is there any \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) does not divide 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\)?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 0 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 6 \\), \\( d = 8 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(6) = 3(9)(36 +9) = 3 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 45 = 27 \u00d7 45.\n\nNow, does 8 divide 27 \u00d7 45?\n\n27 \u00d7 45 = 1215. 1215 \u00f7 8 = 151.875 \u2192 No.\n\nAnother case, \\( n = 9 \\), \\( d = 11 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(9) = 3(12)(81 +9) = 3 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 90 = 36 \u00d7 90.\n\nDoes 11 divide 36 \u00d7 90?\n\nFirst, factorize 36 \u00d7 90 = (4 \u00d7 9) \u00d7 (9 \u00d7 10) = 4 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 10.\n\nBut 11 is a prime number. Does 11 divide 36 \u00d7 90?\n\nLet's compute 36 \u00d7 90 = 3240.\n\nNow, 3240 \u00f7 11 \u2248 294.545 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, it seems that only the cases where \\( n+2 \\) divides 39 work.\n\nBut, to be absolutely sure, perhaps we should consider that \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\n### Final Sum\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's check \\( n = 35 \\), \\( d = 37 \\).\n\nBut 37 is not a divisor of 39. Does 37 divide \\( P(35) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( P(35) = 3(38)(35^2 +9) \\).\n\nFirst, 35^2 = 1225, plus 9 is 1234.\n\nNow, \\( P(35) = 3 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 1234 \\).\n\nDoes 37 divide this? Well, 38 is divisible by 37? No, 38 = 2 \u00d7 19.\n\nAnd 1234 \u00f7 37 \u2248 33.351 \u2192 37 \u00d7 33 = 1221; 1234 - 1221 = 13 \u2192 remainder 13.\n\nThus, 37 does not divide 1234, and since 38 is not divisible by 37, the entire product is not divisible by 37.\n\nThis further confirms that only when \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39 does the condition hold.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given condition are those for which \\( n+2 \\) is a positive divisor of 39, namely 1, 11, and 37.\n\nThus, the sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, wait! What about \\( n+2 = 39 \\times k \\) for some \\( k \\)?\n\nLet's take \\( k=2 \\), so \\( n+2 = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\).\n\nWe already checked that \\( n=76 \\) does not work, because \\( P(76) \\) is not divisible by 78.\n\nThus, only the exact divisors of 39 give valid \\( n \\) values.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( n \\) not in our list that works?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 2 \\), \\( d = 4 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(2) = 3(5)(4 +9) = 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 13 = 195.\n\nDoes 4 divide 195? 195 \u00f7 4 = 48.75 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, it seems that only the cases where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39 work.\n\nBut, what if \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39? We've already considered all positive divisors of 39 that give positive \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's check \\( n = 0 \\) \u2192 invalid, as \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 10 \\), \\( d = 12 \\). We saw that it didn't work.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's check \\( n = 25 \\), \\( d = 27 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(25) = 3(28)(625 +9) = 3 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 634.\n\nDoes 27 divide this?\n\nFirst, factorize 27 = 3^3.\n\nNow, the expression has a factor of 3, but we need two more factors of 3 to make it divisible by 27.\n\nBut 28 and 634 are not divisible by 3 (since 2+8=10, not divisible by 3; and 6+3+4=13, not divisible by 3).\n\nThus, only one factor of 3 is present, so 27 does not divide \\( P(25) \\).\n\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion.\n\n### Are There Any Other Cases?\nIs it possible that for some larger \\( n \\), \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\) without \\( n+2 \\) being a divisor of 39?\n\nSuppose \\( n+2 \\) does not divide 39, but still divides \\( P(n) \\).\n\nFrom the polynomial division, we have:\n\\[ P(n) = (n+2)Q(n) + 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39 for \\( P(n) \\) to be divisible by \\( n+2 \\), unless \\( Q(n) \\) somehow compensates for this, but since \\( Q(n) \\) is a polynomial in \\( n \\), it's not clear how this could happen in general.\n\nHowever, perhaps there are specific \\( n \\) values where \\( Q(n) \\) introduces a factor that cancels out the remainder.\n\nBut, given that \\( P(n) \\equiv 39 \\mod (n+2) \\), \\( n+2 \\) must divide 39 for \\( P(n) \\) to be divisible by \\( n+2 \\).\n\nBut, is this always true? What if \\( Q(n) \\) has a factor that cancels out the remainder?\n\nLet me think about the exact form of \\( Q(n) \\).\n\nWe have:\n\\[ P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\]\n\nLet's perform polynomial division or express \\( P(n) \\) in terms of \\( d = n+2 \\).\n\nLet \\( n = d - 2 \\). Then:\n\n\\[ P(n) = 3(d - 2 + 3)((d-2)^2 +9) = 3(d + 1)(d^2 -4d +4 +9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \\]\n\nNow, \\( d \\) must divide \\( P(n) \\), i.e., \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( d \\) and \\( d+1 \\) are coprime, so \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 -4d \\), because \\( d^2 -4d = d(d-4) \\).\n\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 -4d) + 3(d^2 -4d +13) - 3(d^2 -4d) \\). Wait, no.\n\nActually, \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 -4d \\), so in \\( 3(d^2 -4d +13) \\), \\( d \\) divides \\( 3(d^2 -4d) \\), so \\( d \\) must divide the remaining part, which is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nThis is a more rigorous proof that \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible values for \\( d = n+2 \\) are the divisors of 39, which are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b113, \u00b139.\n\nBut since \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( d = n+2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)).\n\nThus, \\( d \\) can be 3, 13, 39 (since \\( d=1 \\) gives \\( n=-1 \\), invalid; and negative divisors give negative \\( n \\), which are invalid).\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are:\n\n1. \\( d=3 \\) \u2192 \\( n=1 \\)\n2. \\( d=13 \\) \u2192 \\( n=11 \\)\n3. \\( d=39 \\) \u2192 \\( n=37 \\)\n\nThus, the sum is \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, wait! What about \\( n = 38 \\), \\( d = 40 \\)?\n\nBut 40 is not a divisor of 39. According to our reasoning, \\( d \\) must divide 39, so \\( n = 38 \\) would not work.\n\nBut, let's verify:\n\nFor \\( n = 38 \\), \\( d = 40 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(38) = 3(38+3)(38^2 +9) = 3 \u00d7 41 \u00d7 (1444 +9) = 3 \u00d7 41 \u00d7 1453.\n\nDoes 40 divide this? 40 = 8 \u00d7 5.\n\nFirst, check divisibility by 5: 1453 \u00f7 5 = 290.6 \u2192 not divisible by 5. Thus, not divisible by 40.\n\nThis confirms our reasoning.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) is \\( 49 \\).\n\nBut, let's double-check if there are any other \\( n \\) values we might have missed.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 3 \\), \\( d = 5 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(3) = 3(6)(9 +9) = 3 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 18 = 3 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 18 = 3 \u00d7 108 = 324.\n\nDoes 5 divide 324? 324 \u00f7 5 = 64.8 \u2192 No.\n\nAnother case, \\( n = 4 \\), \\( d = 6 \\). Earlier, we saw that \\( P(4) = 525 \\), and 6 does not divide 525.\n\nThus, only the cases where \\( d \\) is a divisor of 39 work.\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's check \\( n = 25 \\), \\( d = 27 \\).\n\nWe already saw that 27 does not divide \\( P(25) \\).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's check \\( n = 26 \\), \\( d = 28 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(26) = 3(29)(26^2 +9) = 3 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 (676 +9) = 3 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 685.\n\nNow, does 28 divide this?\n\nFirst, 28 = 4 \u00d7 7.\n\nCheck divisibility by 7: 685 \u00f7 7 \u2248 97.857 \u2192 not divisible.\n\nThus, 28 does not divide \\( P(26) \\).\n\nThis further confirms that only the cases where \\( d \\) divides 39 work.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are 1, 11, and 37. Their sum is:\n\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, wait! I think I missed something. What about \\( n = 20 \\), \\( d = 22 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(20) = 3(23)(400 +9) = 3 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 409.\n\nNow, does 22 divide this?\n\nFactorize 22 = 2 \u00d7 11.\n\nNow, 409 \u00f7 11 \u2248 37.181 \u2192 11 \u00d7 37 = 407; remainder 2. So, 409 is not divisible by 11, hence not by 22.\n\nThus, it doesn't work.\n\n### Verification of All Cases\nFrom the above analysis, it seems that only when \\( d \\) is a divisor of 39 does the condition hold.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider \\( n = 35 \\), \\( d = 37 \\).\n\nBut 37 is not a divisor of 39. Does 37 divide \\( P(35) \\)?\n\nAs before, \\( P(35) = 3 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 1234 \\). Since 38 is divisible by 37? No, 38 = 2 \u00d7 19.\n\nThus, 37 does not divide 38, and 1234 \u00f7 37 \u2248 33.351 \u2192 not divisible.\n\nThus, only the cases where \\( d \\) is a divisor of 39 work.\n\nBut, is it possible that for some larger \\( n \\), \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\) even if \\( n+2 \\) does not divide 39?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 97 \\), \\( d = 99 \\).\n\nBut 99 is a multiple of 39 (since 39 \u00d7 2.538 \u2248 99, but 99 \u00f7 39 \u2248 2.538, not an integer. Wait, 99 \u00f7 39 \u2248 2.538 \u2192 39 \u00d7 2 = 78, 39 \u00d7 3 = 117. So, 99 is not a multiple of 39.\n\nBut, does 99 divide \\( P(97) \\)?\n\nFirst, \\( P(97) = 3(100)(97^2 +9) \\).\n\nBut 97^2 is 9409 +9 = 9418.\n\nSo, \\( P(97) = 3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 9418 = 300 \u00d7 9418.\n\nNow, does 99 divide 300 \u00d7 9418?\n\nFirst, factorize 99 = 9 \u00d7 11 = 3^2 \u00d7 11.\n\nNow, 300 \u00d7 9418 = 3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 9418.\n\nWe have one factor of 3, but need two (since 99 = 3^2 \u00d7 11). Also, we need a factor of 11.\n\nBut 9418 \u00f7 11 \u2248 856.1818 \u2192 11 \u00d7 856 = 9416, remainder 2. So, not divisible by 11.\n\nThus, 99 does not divide \\( P(97) \\).\n\nThis suggests that indeed, only when \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39 does the condition hold.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 12 \\), \\( d = 14 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(12) = 3(15)(144 +9) = 3 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 153.\n\nNow, does 14 divide this?\n\nFirst, 14 = 2 \u00d7 7.\n\nNow, 153 \u00f7 7 \u2248 21.857 \u2192 7 \u00d7 21 = 147; remainder 6 \u2192 not divisible by 7, hence not by 14.\n\nThus, it doesn't work.\n\n### Final Verification\nFrom all these examples, it seems that the only \\( n \\) values that work are those where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of 39.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nCorresponding \\( n \\) values (for \\( d \\geq 3 \\)) are:\n\n- \\( d=3 \\) \u2192 \\( n=1 \\)\n- \\( d=13 \\) \u2192 \\( n=11 \\)\n- \\( d=39 \\) \u2192 \\( n=37 \\)\n\nFor \\( d=1 \\), \\( n=-1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n\nNegative divisors lead to negative \\( n \\), which are invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, the only valid positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nTheir sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, just to be absolutely sure, let's check \\( n = 37 \\) again.\n\nFor \\( n = 37 \\), \\( d = 39 \\).\n\nCompute \\( P(37) = 3(40)(37^2 +9) \\).\n\nWe already saw that 39 divides \\( P(37) \\), because 39 = 3 \u00d7 13, and:\n\n- The term 3 is present.\n- 37^2 +9 = 1369 +9 = 1378, and 1378 \u00f7 13 \u2248 106 (as before, exact division).\n\nThus, it works.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter thorough verification, the only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are 1, 11, and 37. Their sum is 49.\n\n",
        "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). After finding all such \\( n \\), I need to sum them up.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nI need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).\n\nBut before diving into solving it, perhaps I can rewrite the condition more formally. The condition is:\n\\[ n + 2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\n### Approach\nI recall that divisibility conditions can sometimes be simplified using polynomial identities or substitution. Maybe I can perform polynomial division or factorization to simplify the expression.\n\nBut before diving into complex algebra, perhaps I can try to find a pattern or perform a substitution.\n\nLet me denote \\( k = n + 2 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( k \\) will be an integer \\( k \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nNow, I need to rewrite the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nFirst, express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\\[ n = k - 2 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( n \\) into the expression:\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3((k-2) + 3)((k-2)^2 + 9) \\]\nSimplify the terms inside:\n1. First term: \\( (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1 \\)\n2. Second term: \\( (k-2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 13 \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nNow, the condition \\( n + 2 \\mid \\text{expression} \\) becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) is a factor of the expression. However, \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime (since consecutive integers are always coprime). Therefore, \\( k \\) must divide the remaining part of the expression.\n\nBut the expression is \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). Since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\), because \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, but \\( k \\) is part of the product.\n\nBut, \\( k \\) is a factor of the entire expression, but it's not necessarily that \\( k \\) divides the remaining part if we consider \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) separately. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the entire expression modulo \\( k \\).\n\nBut, perhaps it's easier to think about the divisibility condition:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\), but that's not accurate because \\( k \\) might have common factors with \\( (k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nBut, perhaps it's better to expand everything.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\):\nLet's denote \\( P(k) = (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nFirst, expand \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\):\n1. Multiply \\( k \\) by each term inside the second parentheses:\n   \\[ k \\cdot k^2 = k^3 \\]\n   \\[ k \\cdot (-4k) = -4k^2 \\]\n   \\[ k \\cdot 13 = 13k \\]\n2. Multiply \\( 1 \\) by each term inside the second parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 \\cdot k^2 = k^2 \\]\n   \\[ 1 \\cdot (-4k) = -4k \\]\n   \\[ 1 \\cdot 13 = 13 \\]\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\\[ k^3 - 4k^2 + 13k + k^2 - 4k + 13 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n- \\( k^3 \\) remains.\n- \\( -4k^2 + k^2 = -3k^2 \\)\n- \\( 13k - 4k = 9k \\)\n- \\( +13 \\)\n\nSo, \\( P(k) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\)\n\nNow, the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3P(k) \\]\nBut \\( P(k) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\)\n\nBut \\( k \\) obviously divides \\( k^3, k^2, \\) and \\( k \\) terms. So, the condition reduces to:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) divides \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\) because all terms have \\( k \\) as a factor. Therefore, the condition simplifies to:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\]\n\nBut that's not correct, because the remainder when \\( P(k) \\) is divided by \\( k \\) is the constant term \\( 13 \\). So, the condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\]\n\nBut, \\( P(k) \\) modulo \\( k \\) is \\( P(k) \\mod k = P(0) = 13 \\), because all other terms are divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nBut the condition is \\( k \\mid 3P(k) \\). Since \\( P(k) \\equiv 13 \\mod k \\), the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nBut \\( k = n + 2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( k \\) must be an integer \\( k \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)).\n\nFirst, find all positive divisors of 39. The prime factorization of 39 is:\n\\[ 39 = 3 \\times 13 \\]\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k \\geq 3 \\), so we consider \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nNow, recall that \\( k = n + 2 \\), so we can find \\( n \\) for each valid \\( k \\):\n\n1. For \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 3 \\implies n = 1 \\]\n\n2. For \\( k = 13 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 13 \\implies n = 11 \\]\n\n3. For \\( k = 39 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 39 \\implies n = 37 \\]\n\nBut, what about \\( k = 1 \\)? Well, \\( n \\) must be positive, and \\( k \\geq 3 \\) because \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\). So, \\( k = 1 \\) is not valid since \\( n \\) would be negative.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 0 \\)? The problem specifies positive integers, so \\( n \\) starts from 1.\n\nNow, we have three candidates: \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, we need to verify if these values indeed satisfy the original condition.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 3 \\]\n   The expression becomes \\( 3(1+3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\)\n   Check if 3 divides 120: Yes, because \\( 120 / 3 = 40 \\).\n\n2. For \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\n   The expression becomes \\( 3(11+3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\)\n   But we don't need to compute the exact value. We know from our earlier reasoning that since \\( k = 13 \\) divides 39, and our transformation is valid, it should work. But just to be sure, let's compute it:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\n   But \\( 14 \\times 130 = 14 \\times 130 = 1820 \\), and \\( 3 \\times 1820 = 5460 \\)\n   Now, check if 13 divides 5460. Let's perform the division:\n   \\[ 5460 / 13 = 420 \\] (since \\( 13 \\times 420 = 13 \\times 400 + 13 \\times 20 = 5200 + 260 = 5460 \\))\n   So, yes, it's divisible.\n\n3. For \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 39 \\]\n   The expression becomes \\( 3(37+3)(37^2 + 9) \\). The exact computation is complex, but according to our reasoning, since 39 divides 39, it should work. But to be thorough, perhaps we can think about it modulo 39.\n\nBut, perhaps it's easier to trust our earlier transformation. We've established that \\( k \\) must divide 39, and for each such \\( k \\), the corresponding \\( n \\) is valid.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's think about the general case. We have:\n\\[ n + 2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nWe transformed this into \\( k \\mid 39 \\), where \\( k = n + 2 \\).\n\nBut, is this transformation always valid? Let's double-check.\n\n### Double-Checking the Transformation\nWe had:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut, \\( P(k) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\). When we take \\( P(k) \\mod k \\), we get \\( 13 \\) because all other terms are divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nThus, the condition \\( k \\mid 3P(k) \\) becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times (P(k) \\mod k) \\]\nBut \\( P(k) \\mod k = 13 \\), so:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nThis seems correct. Therefore, any \\( k \\) that divides 39 will satisfy the condition.\n\nBut, we must ensure that for each such \\( k \\), the original condition holds. Since our transformation is reversible, it should hold.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) doesn't divide 39 but still satisfies the original condition? Let's test another value to ensure completeness.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 2 \\), so \\( k = 4 \\). Check if \\( 4 \\) divides \\( 3(2+3)(2^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times (4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\). But \\( 195 / 4 = 48.75 \\), not divisible. So, only \\( k \\) values that divide 39 work.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) doesn't divide 39 but still satisfies the original condition? Let's try \\( n = 5 \\), \\( k = 7 \\):\n\\[ 3(5+3)(5^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 8 \\times (25 + 9) = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 24 \\times 34 = 816 \\]\nNow, \\( 7 \\) divides \\( 816 \\)? Let's check \\( 816 / 7 \\approx 116.571 \\), no.\n\nAnother example, \\( n = 4 \\), \\( k = 6 \\):\n\\[ 3(4+3)(4^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times (16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 21 \\times 25 = 525 \\]\nNow, \\( 6 \\) divides \\( 525 \\)? \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\), no.\n\nThis suggests that only the \\( k \\) values that divide 39 work.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 0 \\)? The problem specifies positive integers, so \\( n = 0 \\) is not considered.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 0 \\) was considered? \\( k = 2 \\), and 2 does not divide 39. But \\( n = 0 \\) is not positive, so it's irrelevant.\n\n### Checking for Other Divisors\nAre there any other \\( k \\) values that might work? Suppose \\( k \\) doesn't divide 39 but still satisfies the original condition.\n\nLet's take \\( n = 10 \\), \\( k = 12 \\):\n\\[ 3(10+3)(10^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 13 \\times (100 + 9) = 3 \\times 13 \\times 109 = 39 \\times 109 = 39 \\times 110 - 39 \\times 1 = 4290 - 39 = 4251 \\]\nNow, does 12 divide 4251? \\( 4251 / 12 = 354.25 \\), no.\n\nThis suggests that only the \\( k \\) values that divide 39 satisfy the condition.\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps we should consider that \\( k \\) might divide \\( 3P(k) \\) even if it doesn't divide 39. However, from our earlier analysis, \\( P(k) \\mod k = 13 \\), so \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( k \\) values are the positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\): 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what about \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( k = -1, -3, -13, -39 \\)? Since \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( k \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nThus, the valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? What if there are larger \\( k \\) values that divide \\( 3P(k) \\) but not 39?\n\nLet's think about the general condition. We have:\n\\[ k \\mid 3P(k) \\]\nBut \\( P(k) \\mod k = 13 \\), so:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39. The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we consider \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nTherefore, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n1. \\( k = 3 \\implies n = 1 \\)\n2. \\( k = 13 \\implies n = 11 \\)\n3. \\( k = 39 \\implies n = 37 \\)\n\nBut, what if \\( k = 1 \\)? Then \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, only the above cases are valid.\n\nBut, is it possible that there are other \\( k \\) values not dividing 39 that satisfy the condition? Let's test \\( k = 39 \\times m \\) for some \\( m \\), but \\( k \\) must divide 39, so unless \\( m = 1 \\), it won't work.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39? Let's try \\( k = 78 \\) (i.e., \\( n = 76 \\)):\n\nCompute \\( 3P(k) \\) for \\( k = 78 \\):\nBut \\( P(k) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\), and \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3P(k) \\). But \\( P(k) \\mod k = 13 \\), so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 39 \\).\n\nBut, for \\( k = 78 \\), does 78 divide 39? No, because 39 is not divisible by 78.\n\nBut, \\( 3P(k) = 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\). For \\( k = 78 \\):\nWe need to check if 78 divides \\( 3P(78) \\).\n\nBut, \\( P(k) \\mod k = 13 \\), so \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\). Thus, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut 78 does not divide 39. Therefore, only \\( k \\) values that divide 39 satisfy the condition.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39, and the corresponding \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39? Let's see:\n\nFor any \\( k \\) that is a multiple of 39, say \\( k = 39 \\times t \\), then \\( k \\) divides \\( 3P(k) \\) only if \\( k \\) divides 39. But \\( k = 39 \\times t \\) can only divide 39 if \\( t = 1 \\) and \\( k = 39 \\).\n\nFor \\( t > 1 \\), \\( k = 39t \\) does not divide 39 unless \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nBut, \\( 3P(k) = 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3P(k) \\). Let's write \\( P(k) \\) explicitly in terms of \\( k \\):\n\\[ P(k) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\]\n\nThus, \\( 3P(k) = 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\)\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide \\( 3P(k) \\), \\( k \\) must divide the remainder when \\( 3P(k) \\) is divided by \\( k \\). But, as before, all terms except the constant term are divisible by \\( k \\). The constant term is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\): 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what about \\( k = 1 \\)? \\( n = -1 \\) is not positive. \\( k = 1 \\) is not in our range since \\( k \\geq 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, we need to ensure that there are no other \\( k \\) values. Suppose \\( k \\) is a non-divisor of 39. Then, \\( k \\) does not divide 39, but does \\( k \\) divide \\( 3P(k) \\)?\n\nLet's test \\( k = 9 \\) (which does not divide 39):\nCompute \\( 3P(9) \\):\nFirst, compute \\( P(9) = 9^3 - 3 \\times 9^2 + 9 \\times 9 + 13 = 729 - 243 + 81 + 13 = (729 - 243) = 486; 486 + 81 = 567; 567 + 13 = 580 \\)\nNow, \\( 3P(9) = 3 \\times 580 = 1740 \\)\nDoes 9 divide 1740? \\( 1740 / 9 \\approx 193.333 \\), no.\n\nAnother example, \\( k = 6 \\):\nCompute \\( P(6) = 6^3 - 3 \\times 6^2 + 9 \\times 6 + 13 = 216 - 108 + 54 + 13 = (216 - 108) = 108; 108 + 54 = 162; 162 + 13 = 175 \\)\nThen, \\( 3P(6) = 3 \\times 175 = 525 \\)\nDoes 6 divide 525? \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\), no.\n\nThis suggests that indeed, only the divisors of 39 satisfy the condition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only valid \\( k \\) values are the positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\), which are 3, 13, and 39. Therefore, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n\n1. For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\)\n2. For \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\)\n3. For \\( k = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nBut, we should also check if there are any larger \\( k \\) values. Suppose \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39. Let's try \\( k = 39 \\times m \\), but as seen, unless \\( m = 1 \\), \\( k \\) won't divide 39.\n\nFor example, \\( k = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\). Let's verify:\n\nCompute \\( 3P(78) \\). But, we know that \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\). For \\( k \\) to divide \\( 3P(k) \\), \\( k \\) must divide 39. Since 78 does not divide 39, \\( n = 76 \\) is not valid.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) are valid.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps there are other \\( k \\) values not divisors of 39 that satisfy \\( k \\mid 3P(k) \\).\n\nLet's take \\( k = 39 \\times t \\). Then, \\( 3P(k) = 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\).\n\nBut \\( P(k) \\mod k = 13 \\), so \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\). Thus, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nSince \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we have \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39 but still \\( k \\) divides \\( 3P(k) \\)?\n\nLet's consider that \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3P(k) \\), but \\( 3P(k) = 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\) is clearly divisible by \\( k \\), so \\( 3P(k) = 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) + 39 \\).\n\nThus, \\( 3P(k) \\equiv 39 \\mod k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, we must check if there are any other \\( k \\) values. For example, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39? Let's say \\( k = 39 \\times m \\). Then, \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\), but \\( k = 39m \\), so \\( 39m \\) must divide 39. This is only possible if \\( m = 1 \\), meaning \\( k = 39 \\).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\): 3, 13, 39.\n\n### Verification of n values\nLet's verify all three \\( n \\) values to ensure correctness.\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 3 \\]\n   \\[ 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(4)(1 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\n   3 divides 120.\n\n2. \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\n   \\[ 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(14)(121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\n   We already saw that 13 divides this.\n\n3. \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 39 \\]\n   \\[ 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(40)(1369 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\]\n   We know that 39 must divide this product. But, 39 = 3 \u00d7 13. So, we need to check if both 3 and 13 divide the product.\n\n   The product is \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\). Clearly, 3 divides it. Now, does 13 divide it?\n\n   We need to check if 13 divides \\( 40 \\times 1378 \\).\n\n   First, find \\( 40 \\mod 13 = 1 \\) (since \\( 13 \\times 3 = 39 \\), remainder 1).\n   Now, find \\( 1378 \\mod 13 \\). Let's compute 1378 divided by 13:\n   \\( 13 \\times 106 = 1378 \\) because \\( 13 \\times 100 = 1300 \\), \\( 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\), total \\( 1300 + 78 = 1378 \\). So, \\( 1378 \\mod 13 = 0 \\).\n\n   Therefore, \\( 40 \\times 1378 \\) is divisible by 13 (since 1378 is divisible by 13). Thus, the entire product is divisible by 39.\n\nThus, all three \\( n \\) values satisfy the condition.\n\n### Are there any other n values?\nWe've considered all divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\). But, is it possible that some other \\( k \\) (not a divisor of 39) satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) does not divide 39. Then, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\). But since \\( k \\) divides all terms except the constant term, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39? Let's say \\( k = 39m \\). Then, \\( 3P(k) = 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( k^3 \\) term is \\( k^3 = (39m)^3 \\), but the constant term is 39. For \\( k \\) to divide \\( 3P(k) \\), \\( 39m \\) must divide 39, which implies \\( m = 1 \\). Thus, the only solution is \\( k = 39 \\), which we've already considered.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a multiple of 39 but still divides \\( 3P(k) \\)?\n\nLet's think about \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\).\n\nBut, as before, \\( k \\) must divide the remainder when \\( 3P(k) \\) is divided by \\( k \\), which is 39. Thus, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, there are no other \\( k \\) values beyond the divisors of 39.\n\n### Final n values and their sum\nFrom above, the valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all such positive integers \\( n \\):\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? What if there are larger \\( k \\) values?\n\nSuppose \\( k = 39 \\times p \\) where \\( p \\) is an integer greater than 1. Let's see if any such \\( k \\) can satisfy the condition.\n\nTake \\( k = 78 \\) (i.e., \\( p = 2 \\)):\nWe need \\( k \\) to divide 39, but 78 does not divide 39. Thus, no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, for any \\( k \\) that is not a divisor of 39, the condition fails because \\( k \\) must divide 39, but larger multiples of 39 do not divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's check \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive, so it's excluded.\n\nWhat about \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\)? Not positive, so excluded.\n\nWhat about \\( k = 39 \\times 2 = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\). Let's verify:\n\nCompute \\( 3P(78) \\mod 78 \\). As before, \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\). So, \\( 3P(78) \\mod 78 = 39 \\). For 78 to divide \\( 3P(78) \\), we must have 78 divides 39, which is false.\n\nThus, only the divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\) work, leading to \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, we must also consider negative divisors of 39, but \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) since \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut, wait! Are there any other divisors of 39? The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nSince \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we have \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\), corresponding to \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a non-trivial multiple? For example, \\( k = 39 \\times t \\). But as shown, for \\( t > 1 \\), \\( k \\) does not divide 39, so no additional solutions.\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, let's double-check if there are any other \\( n \\) values. Suppose \\( n = 3 \\), \\( k = 5 \\):\nCompute \\( 3P(5) = 3(5^3 - 3 \\times 5^2 + 9 \\times 5 + 13) = 3(125 - 75 + 45 + 13) = 3(125 - 75 = 50; 50 + 45 = 95; 95 + 13 = 108) = 3 \\times 108 = 324 \\)\nNow, does 5 divide 324? No, because 324 \u00f7 5 = 64.8.\n\nThis confirms that only the divisors of 39 work.\n\n### Are there any other cases?\nWhat if \\( n + 2 \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39 but still satisfies the original condition?\n\nLet's think about \\( n = 2 \\), \\( k = 4 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(2+3)(2^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times (4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 15 \\times 13 = 195 \\)\nDoes 4 divide 195? \\( 195 / 4 = 48.75 \\), no.\n\nAnother example, \\( n = 6 \\), \\( k = 8 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(6+3)(6^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 9 \\times (36 + 9) = 3 \\times 9 \\times 45 = 27 \\times 45 = 1215 \\)\nDoes 8 divide 1215? \\( 1215 / 8 = 151.875 \\), no.\n\nThus, it seems that only the \\( n \\) values corresponding to the divisors of 39 work.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps we missed something. Let's consider \\( n = 7 \\), \\( k = 9 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(7+3)(7^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 10 \\times (49 + 9) = 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 = 30 \\times 58 = 1740 \\)\nDoes 9 divide 1740? \\( 1740 / 9 \\approx 193.333 \\), no.\n\nThus, our initial conclusion seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, let's see if there are any other divisors we missed. The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nWe've considered \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\). What about \\( k = 1 \\)?\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, we don't consider it.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, wait! What about larger \\( n \\) values? For example, \\( n = 38 \\), \\( k = 40 \\):\nCompute \\( 3P(40) \\mod 40 \\). But, \\( P(40) \\mod 40 = 13 \\), so \\( 3P(40) \\mod 40 = 39 \\). Does 40 divide 39? No.\n\nThus, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) work, leading to \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, let's think about \\( n = 38 \\), \\( k = 40 \\). But 40 does not divide 39, so it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( n \\) that we might have missed? Let's try \\( n = 0 \\) (but \\( n \\) must be positive), or \\( n = -1 \\) (invalid).\n\nWhat about \\( n = 4 \\), \\( k = 6 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(4+3)(4^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times (16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 21 \\times 25 = 525 \\)\nDoes 6 divide 525? \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\), no.\n\nThus, it seems that only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's try \\( n = 3 \\), \\( k = 5 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(3+3)(3^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 6 \\times (9 + 9) = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 18 \\times 18 = 324 \\)\nDoes 5 divide 324? \\( 324 / 5 = 64.8 \\), no.\n\nThus, our initial conclusion seems correct.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps there's a case where \\( k \\) does not divide 39 but still satisfies \\( k \\mid 3P(k) \\).\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) is such that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) = 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\\[ k(3k^2 - 9k + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\). But \\( k \\) divides all terms except the last term (39). Therefore, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we have \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\), leading to \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, wait! What if \\( k \\) is a divisor of 39, but not necessarily in the list? The complete list is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nWe've already considered 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k = 1 \\)? Then \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, no additional solutions.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, perhaps we missed \\( k = 39 \\times \\) something else.\n\nLet me think about \\( k \\) not necessarily a divisor of 39 but still satisfies \\( k \\mid 3P(k) \\).\n\nFrom the expression:\n\\[ 3P(k) = 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 = 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide \\( 3P(k) \\), it must divide the remainder when all terms divisible by \\( k \\) are removed. The only remainder is the constant term 39.\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must divide 39. Therefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nThus, the only positive integer solutions for \\( n \\) are 1, 11, and 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut, looking back, I think I might have missed something. What if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39 but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose \\( k = 78 \\), which is \\( 39 \\times 2 \\).\n\nWe have \\( 3P(78) = 3 \\times (78^3 - 3 \\times 78^2 + 9 \\times 78 + 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\), so \\( 3P(78) \\mod 78 = 39 \\). For 78 to divide \\( 3P(78) \\), we need \\( 78 \\) to divide 39, which is false.\n\nSimilarly, for any \\( k \\) that does not divide 39, \\( k \\) will not divide 39, and hence \\( k \\) will not divide \\( 3P(k) \\), because \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nSince \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we consider \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\), giving \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a larger multiple of 39?\n\nLet \\( k = 39 \\times t \\). Then, \\( 3P(k) \\mod k = 39 \\). For \\( k \\) to divide \\( 3P(k) \\), \\( 39 \\times t \\) must divide 39, which is only possible if \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) is 39 (and its divisors).\n\nBut, we've already considered all divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's see if there are any other \\( n \\) values.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 36 \\), \\( k = 38 \\):\nCompute \\( 3P(38) \\mod 38 \\), which is 39. Does 38 divide 39? No.\n\nThus, no other \\( n \\) values satisfy the condition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\) is \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLet me try another approach: polynomial division or substitution.\n\nLet me denote \\( d = n + 2 \\). Then, \\( n = d - 2 \\).\n\nThe condition becomes:\n\\[ d \\mid 3((d-2) + 3)((d-2)^2 + 9) \\]\nSimplify:\n\\[ d \\mid 3(d + 1)( (d-2)^2 + 9 ) \\]\n\nNow, expand \\( (d-2)^2 + 9 \\):\n\\[ d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9 = d^2 - 4d + 13 \\]\n\nThus, the condition is:\n\\[ d \\mid 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nLet me denote \\( Q(d) = 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nWe need \\( d \\) to divide \\( Q(d) \\).\n\nBut, \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are coprime, so \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), because \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are coprime, and \\( d \\) already divides the term \\( d \\) in the product.\n\nWait, no. The condition is \\( d \\) divides the entire product \\( Q(d) \\).\n\nBut, \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are coprime, so \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), but that's not correct because \\( d \\) might have common factors with \\( d^2 - 4d + 13 \\).\n\nInstead, since \\( d \\) is coprime with \\( d + 1 \\), \\( d \\) must divide the rest of the expression multiplied by 3 and \\( (d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nBut, it's better to perform polynomial division or look for roots.\n\nLet's expand \\( Q(d) \\):\nFirst, expand \\( (d^2 - 4d + 13)(d + 1) \\).\n\nLet me set \\( A = d^2 - 4d + 13 \\), so \\( Q(d) = 3A(d + 1) \\).\n\nBut, \\( d \\) must divide \\( Q(d) \\), i.e., \\( d \\mid 3A(d + 1) \\).\n\nSince \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3A \\).\n\nBut \\( A = d^2 - 4d + 13 \\).\n\nThus, the condition is:\n\\[ d \\mid 3(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nBut, \\( d \\) obviously divides \\( d^2 - 4d \\), because:\n\\[ d^2 - 4d = d(d - 4) \\]\nThus, \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 - 4d \\), and so \\( d \\) must also divide the remaining part, which is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nBut, \\( d \\) divides \\( 3(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), and since \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 - 4d \\), it must divide the remaining term \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nThus, \\( d \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nBut, \\( d = n + 2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( d \\) must be an integer \\( \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( d = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nSince \\( d \\geq 3 \\), we consider \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n1. \\( d = 3 \\implies n = 1 \\)\n2. \\( d = 13 \\implies n = 11 \\)\n3. \\( d = 39 \\implies n = 37 \\)\n\nNow, check \\( d = 1 \\), which would give \\( n = -1 \\) (invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive).\n\nThus, the valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is a multiple of 39? For example, \\( d = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\).\n\nThen, we need to check if \\( d = 78 \\) divides \\( Q(d) \\).\n\nBut, as before, \\( d \\) must divide 39, but 78 does not divide 39. Thus, no additional solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's verify \\( n = 37 \\):\n- \\( d = 39 \\)\n- \\( Q(d) = 3(39 + 1)(39^2 - 4 \\times 39 + 13) \\)\nBut, we don't need to compute this because we've already established that \\( d \\) must divide 39, and 39 is one of the divisors.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me try \\( n = 10 \\), \\( d = 12 \\):\nCompute \\( Q(12) = 3(12^2 - 4 \\times 12 + 13)(12 + 1) = 3(144 - 48 + 13)(13) = 3(109)(13) \\)\nNow, does 12 divide \\( 3 \\times 109 \\times 13 \\)?\n\nCompute \\( 3 \\times 109 \\times 13 = 3 \\times 109 \\times 13 = 3 \\times 109 \\times 13 = 3 \\times 1417 = 4251 \\)\nDoes 12 divide 4251? \\( 4251 / 12 = 354.25 \\), no.\n\nThus, only the divisors of 39 work.\n\n### Final Verification\nLet's verify all three \\( n \\) values:\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\), \\( d = 3 \\):\n   \\( Q(3) = 3(3^2 - 4 \\times 3 + 13)(3 + 1) = 3(9 - 12 + 13)(4) = 3(10)(4) = 120 \\)\n   Does 3 divide 120? Yes.\n\n2. \\( n = 11 \\), \\( d = 13 \\):\n   \\( Q(13) = 3(13^2 - 4 \\times 13 + 13)(13 + 1) = 3(169 - 52 + 13)(14) = 3(130)(14) = 3 \\times 130 \\times 14 = 3 \\times 130 \\times 14 \\)\n   Clearly, 13 divides this product since 130 is divisible by 13 (130 = 13 \u00d7 10).\n\n3. \\( n = 37 \\), \\( d = 39 \\):\n   \\( Q(39) = 3(39^2 - 4 \\times 39 + 13)(39 + 1) = 3(1521 - 156 + 13)(40) = 3(1521 - 156 = 1365; 1365 + 13 = 1378)(40) \\)\n   Now, does 39 divide this? Well, 39 = 3 \u00d7 13, and we know that 13 divides 1378 (as seen earlier, 1378 \u00f7 13 = 106), and 3 is present in the coefficient. Thus, 39 divides the product.\n\nThus, all three \\( n \\) values satisfy the condition.\n\n### Are there any other n values?\nSuppose \\( n = 75 \\), \\( d = 77 \\). Does 77 divide \\( Q(77) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( Q(77) = 3(77^2 - 4 \\times 77 + 13)(77 + 1) \\)\nFirst, compute \\( 77^2 = 5929 \\), then \\( 4 \\times 77 = 308 \\), so:\n\\( 5929 - 308 + 13 = 5929 - 308 = 5621; 5621 + 13 = 5634 \\)\nNow, \\( Q(77) = 3 \\times 5634 \\times 78 \\)\nNow, does 77 divide this?\n\nFirst, factorize 77: 7 \u00d7 11.\nNow, check if both 7 and 11 divide the product.\n\nFirst, check 7:\n- 5634 \u00f7 7: 7 \u00d7 800 = 5600; 5634 - 5600 = 34; 34 is not divisible by 7. Wait, 7 \u00d7 804 = 5628; 5634 - 5628 = 6. So, 5634 is not divisible by 7.\n\nBut, \\( Q(77) = 3 \\times 5634 \\times 78 \\). Since 5634 is not divisible by 7, and neither 3 nor 78 is divisible by 7, the entire product is not divisible by 7, and hence not by 77.\n\nThus, \\( n = 75 \\) does not work, confirming our earlier conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are 1, 11, and 37. Their sum is:\n\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps there's another divisor. The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nWe've already considered 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a negative divisor? But \\( n \\) must be positive, and \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)), so negative divisors are irrelevant here.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me try \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive, so it's excluded.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 38 \\), \\( k = 40 \\):\nCompute \\( Q(40) = 3(40^2 - 4 \\times 40 + 13)(40 + 1) = 3(1600 - 160 + 13)(41) = 3(1600 - 160 = 1440; 1440 + 13 = 1453)(41) \\)\nNow, does 40 divide \\( 3 \\times 1453 \\times 41 \\)?\n\nFirst, compute \\( 3 \\times 1453 \\times 41 \\). But, 40 must divide this product.\n\nBut, 1453 mod 40:\nCompute 1453 \u00f7 40: 40 \u00d7 36 = 1440; remainder is 1453 - 1440 = 13.\nSo, 1453 mod 40 = 13.\nThus, \\( 3 \\times 1453 \\times 41 \\mod 40 = 3 \\times 13 \\times 41 \\mod 40 \\).\n\nBut, 41 mod 40 = 1, so:\n\\( 3 \\times 13 \\times 1 = 39 \\mod 40 \\), which is 39, not 0. Thus, 40 does not divide \\( Q(40) \\).\n\nThus, only the divisors of 39 work.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]\n",
        "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Finally, we need to sum all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe condition is that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). In other words, \\( n+2 \\) must be a factor of the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).\n\n### Rewriting the Condition\nFirst, I recall that if \\( d \\) divides \\( a \\), then \\( a \\equiv 0 \\mod d \\). Here, \\( d = n+2 \\). But \\( n \\) is expressed in terms of \\( d \\). Let me make a substitution to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me set \\( k = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = k - 2 \\).\n\nNow, rewrite the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\n1. \\( n + 3 = (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1 \\)\n2. \\( n^2 + 9 = (k - 2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 13 \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nNow, the condition is that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) is \\( n + 2 \\), and since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( k \\) must be an integer \\( k \\geq 3 \\) (because \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\n### Analyzing the Divisibility Condition\nThe condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nFirst, observe that \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are consecutive integers, so they are coprime, i.e., \\( \\gcd(k, k+1) = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must divide the remaining part of the expression, but we need to be careful because \\( k \\) might have common factors with the other terms.\n\nBut before diving into that, perhaps it's easier to consider the expression modulo \\( k \\). For \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, the expression must be congruent to 0 modulo \\( k \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) obviously divides \\( k \\) itself, but in the expression, \\( k \\) is not explicitly present. However, the term \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\) needs to be considered modulo \\( k \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\), so we can substitute \\( k = 0 \\) into the expression \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\) modulo \\( k \\):\n\n- \\( k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\mod k \\) (since \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\))\n- \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\equiv 0 - 0 + 13 \\equiv 13 \\mod k \\)\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\equiv 3 \\times 1 \\times 13 \\mod k \\]\n\\[ \\equiv 39 \\mod k \\]\n\nTherefore, the condition simplifies to:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. The original condition is that \\( k \\) divides the entire expression. But in the simplified form, we have:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) is part of the expression. Let's expand it properly.\n\n### Expanding the Expression\nLet's expand \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( k \\) by each term inside the second parentheses:\n\\[ k \\times k^2 = k^3 \\]\n\\[ k \\times (-4k) = -4k^2 \\]\n\\[ k \\times 13 = 13k \\]\n\nNow, multiply \\( 1 \\) by each term inside the second parentheses:\n\\[ 1 \\times k^2 = k^2 \\]\n\\[ 1 \\times (-4k) = -4k \\]\n\\[ 1 \\times 13 = 13 \\]\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\\[ k^3 - 4k^2 + 13k + k^2 - 4k + 13 \\]\nSimplify:\n\\[ k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 3:\n\\[ 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) = 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\]\n\nNow, the condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid (3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) obviously divides \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\) because all terms have a \\( k \\) in them. So, the condition reduces to:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBut, is this accurate? Let's verify:\n\nThe expression is \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\). We can write it as:\n\\[ k(3k^2 - 9k + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, \\( k \\) must divide the remainder term, which is 39, because the rest is already divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nThus, indeed, the condition simplifies to:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBut, is this always true? Let me double-check.\n\n### Verification\nLet's take \\( k = 39 \\):\nThe expression becomes \\( 3(39)^3 - 9(39)^2 + 27(39) + 39 \\). Clearly, 39 divides all terms since each term has a factor of 39.\n\nBut what if \\( k \\) is a divisor of 39? Let's test \\( k = 3 \\) (since 3 is a divisor of 39):\n- The expression becomes \\( 3(3)^3 - 9(3)^2 + 27(3) + 39 = 3(27) - 9(9) + 81 + 39 = 81 - 81 + 81 + 39 = 120 \\). But 3 does not divide 120? Wait, 120 / 3 = 40, so it does divide it.\n\nBut according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. And 3 divides 39 (since 39 = 3 \u00d7 13). So, it works.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 13 \\) (another divisor of 39):\n- The expression becomes \\( 3(13)^3 - 9(13)^2 + 27(13) + 39 \\). But calculating this seems tedious, but according to our simplified condition, since 13 divides 39, it should work.\n\nBut, is the simplified condition sufficient? Let's think about it.\n\nThe original expression is \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). For \\( k \\) to divide this expression, and knowing that \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\) because \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime.\n\nBut, \\( k \\) might not be coprime with \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\). Hmm, perhaps it's better to stick with the expanded form.\n\nFrom the expanded form, we saw that the expression can be written as \\( k \\times \\text{something} + 39 \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, is there any other condition? What if the term \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\) is not divisible by \\( k \\)? But it clearly is, because all terms have a \\( k \\) in them.\n\nThus, the condition indeed reduces to \\( k \\) dividing 39.\n\n### Finding Divisors of 39\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut recall that \\( k = n + 2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( k \\) must be at least 3 (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nThus, possible values for \\( k \\) are: 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k \\) can also be 1, but \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) because \\( n \\geq 1 \\):\n- For \\( n = 1 \\), \\( k = 3 \\)\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), \\( k = 4 \\) but 4 is not a divisor of 39.\nBut \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39, and \\( k \\geq 3 \\). So, \\( k \\) can be 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 0 \\)? But \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\), and \\( k \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( k = 1 \\)? For \\( n \\) to be positive, \\( k \\) must be at least 3, because:\n- If \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( n = k - 2 = -1 \\) (not positive)\n- If \\( k = 2 \\), then \\( n = 0 \\) (not positive)\n- If \\( k = 3 \\), then \\( n = 1 \\) (valid)\n- If \\( k = 13 \\), then \\( n = 11 \\) (valid)\n- If \\( k = 39 \\), then \\( n = 37 \\) (valid)\n\nBut, what about \\( k = -3, -13, -39 \\)? But \\( n \\) must be positive, and \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) as established.\n\nBut, \\( k \\) can also be negative divisors, but \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\) because \\( n \\) is positive.\n\nBut, 39 has only positive divisors: 1, 3, 13, 39. And \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\). So, \\( k \\) can be 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k = 1 \\)? \\( n = k - 2 = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\nFor \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\)\nFor \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\)\nFor \\( k = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nBut, is \\( k = 1 \\) possible? For \\( n = -1 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive. So, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are valid.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a negative divisor? For example, \\( k = -3 \\), then \\( n = k - 2 = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, only positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\) are relevant.\n\nBut, 39 has divisors: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid\n- For \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid\n- For \\( k = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid\n\nBut, is this all? What if \\( k \\) is larger than 39? For example, \\( k = 78 \\) (which is \\( 2 \\times 39 \\)). Let's test \\( k = 78 \\):\n\nBut, according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. But 78 does not divide 39. So, only the divisors of 39 are valid.\n\nBut, is our simplified condition complete? What if there's more to it?\n\nLet me think about it again. The condition is that \\( k \\) divides the entire expression. From the expanded form, we have:\n\n\\[ 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\]\n\nWe can factor \\( k \\) out of the first three terms:\n\n\\[ k(3k^2 - 9k + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, \\( k \\) must divide the remaining term, which is 39. But, what if the term \\( (3k^2 - 9k + 27) \\) is not an integer? No, it's a polynomial in \\( k \\), so it's always defined for integer \\( k \\).\n\nBut, is it possible that \\( k \\) does not divide 39, but still divides the entire expression? Let's see.\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) does not divide 39, but the entire expression is divisible by \\( k \\). That would mean that \\( k \\) must divide the term \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\) in such a way that the remainder cancels out the 39.\n\nBut, \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k = 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) \\). So, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 39 \\), because the term \\( 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) \\) is already divisible by \\( k \\). Thus, the condition reduces to \\( k \\) dividing 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible values for \\( k \\) are the positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\), which are 3, 13, and 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a divisor of 39 but \\( k \\) is less than 3? As discussed, \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\) for \\( n \\) to be positive. So, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are valid.\n\n### Finding Corresponding \\( n \\) Values\nNow, recall that \\( k = n + 2 \\). So, for each valid \\( k \\), we can find \\( n \\):\n\n1. For \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[ n = k - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\n2. For \\( k = 13 \\):\n   \\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\]\n\n3. For \\( k = 39 \\):\n   \\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\]\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? What if there are other \\( k \\) values that satisfy the condition but are not divisors of 39?\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose \\( k \\) does not divide 39. Then, the expression \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\) must be divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nBut, as we saw, the expression can be written as \\( k \\times \\text{something} + 39 \\). For \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, \\( k \\) must divide 39, because the other part is already divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a divisor of 39 but \\( n \\) is not positive? We already considered that. For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) (invalid). For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) (valid), and so on.\n\n### Checking for Other Divisors\nAre there any other positive divisors of 39? The prime factorization of 39 is \\( 3 \\times 13 \\). So, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nOnly \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) give positive \\( n \\) values.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is negative? For example, \\( k = -3 \\):\n- \\( n = k - 2 = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are valid.\n\n### Verifying Solutions\nLet's verify each candidate \\( n \\) to ensure correctness.\n\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 3 \\]\n   The product is \\( 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\)\n   Now, check if 3 divides 120: \\( 120 / 3 = 40 \\) \u2192 Yes.\n\n2. For \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\n   The product is \\( 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\)\n   But, we don't need to compute the exact value. We know from our earlier reasoning that since \\( k = 13 \\) divides 39, and our simplified condition holds, it should work.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's compute it:\nFirst, \\( 11^2 + 9 = 121 + 9 = 130 \\)\nNow, \\( 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\)\nBut, \\( n + 2 = 13 \\). So, does 13 divide \\( 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\)?\n\nLet's break it down:\n- 130 is divisible by 13 (since \\( 13 \\times 10 = 130 \\))\nThus, the entire product is divisible by 13.\n\n3. For \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 39 \\]\n   The product is \\( 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times (1369 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\)\n   Now, check if 39 divides this. Again, exact computation is complex, but according to our reasoning, since \\( k = 39 \\) divides 39, it should work.\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps we should check if there are other \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Exploring Non-Divisor Cases\nWhat if \\( k \\) does not divide 39, but still satisfies the original condition? Let's suppose \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39. Then, the term \\( 39 \\) must be canceled out by the other terms.\n\nBut, the other terms are \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\), which is \\( 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) \\).\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, but not necessarily divide 39, the following must hold:\n\\[ k \\mid (3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39) \\]\n\nBut, \\( k \\) already divides \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\), so \\( k \\) must also divide 39. Therefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are indeed the divisors of 39.\n\nThus, our initial conclusion seems correct.\n\nBut, is it possible that for some \\( k \\), the term \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\) cancels out the 39 in a non-trivial way?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) does not divide 39. Then, the expression modulo \\( k \\) is just 39, because all other terms are divisible by \\( k \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must divide 39 for the entire expression to be divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\n### Considering All Divisors\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, as discussed, only \\( k \\geq 3 \\) are relevant since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. \\( k = 3 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 1 \\)\n2. \\( k = 13 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 11 \\)\n3. \\( k = 39 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nNow, what about \\( k = 1 \\)? Then \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, we can ignore it.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a positive divisor? For example, \\( k = -3 \\), but \\( n \\) would be negative, which is invalid.\n\nThus, the valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? What if there are larger \\( k \\) values?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39. For the expression to be divisible by \\( k \\), we must have:\n\\[ 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\]\nBut, as before, the first three terms are divisible by \\( k \\), so we must have:\n\\[ 39 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\]\nWhich implies \\( k \\) divides 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are indeed the positive divisors of 39.\n\n### Checking for Larger \\( k \\) Values\nAre there any larger \\( k \\) values that divide 39? No, because 39 is finite and its largest divisor is 39 itself.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39? For example, \\( k = 78 \\). Then, \\( n = 76 \\).\n\nLet's test \\( n = 76 \\):\n- \\( n + 2 = 78 \\)\n- The product is \\( 3(76 + 3)(76^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 79 \\times (5776 + 9) = 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\)\n\nNow, does 78 divide this product? It's not immediately clear, but according to our earlier reasoning, \\( k \\) must divide 39. But 78 does not divide 39 (since 39/78 is not an integer).\n\nBut, according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. But 78 does not divide 39. Therefore, \\( k = 78 \\) is not valid.\n\nThis suggests that our simplified condition is correct, and only \\( k \\) values that divide 39 are valid.\n\nBut, in the case of \\( k = 78 \\), does it satisfy the original condition? Let's see:\n\nThe original condition is that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\).\n\nFor \\( k = 78 \\), we need to check if 78 divides \\( 3(79)(78^2 - 4 \\times 78 + 13) \\).\n\nBut, 78 is \\( 3 \\times 26 \\). So, we need to see if the expression is divisible by 78.\n\nFirst, the term \\( 3 \\) is present, so we need the rest to be divisible by 26.\n\nBut, \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) for \\( k = 78 \\):\n\\[ 78^2 - 4 \\times 78 + 13 = 6084 - 312 + 13 = 6084 - 312 = 5772 + 13 = 5785 \\]\n\nNow, \\( 3(79)(5785) \\). Does 78 divide this?\n\nFirst, simplify 78 into its prime factors: \\( 78 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\).\n\nThe expression is \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\).\n\nWe already have a factor of 3, so we need the rest to be divisible by \\( 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\).\n\nThus, we need \\( 79 \\times 5785 \\) to be divisible by 26.\n\nBut, 79 is a prime number and does not divide 26. Also, 5785 divided by 26 is approximately 222.5 (since \\( 26 \\times 222 = 26 \\times 200 = 5200, plus 26 \\times 22 = 572, total 5200 + 572 = 5772 \\), and 5785 - 5772 = 13. So, remainder is 13.\n\nThus, 5785 is not divisible by 26 (remainder is 13). Therefore, 78 does not divide the expression.\n\nThis confirms that only the divisors of 39 work, and not their multiples.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, the only valid \\( k \\) values are the positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\), which are 3, 13, and 39.\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n1. \\( n = 1 \\) (from \\( k = 3 \\))\n2. \\( n = 11 \\) (from \\( k = 13 \\))\n3. \\( n = 37 \\) (from \\( k = 39 \\))\n\nBut, we need to ensure that there are no other \\( n \\) values. What if \\( n = 0 \\)? But \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n = 0 \\) is invalid.\n\n### Checking for Edge Cases\nAre there any other \\( n \\) values? Let's try \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive. So, \\( n \\) starts from 1.\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), as before, it works.\nFor \\( n = 11 \\), it works.\nFor \\( n = 37 \\), it works.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 0 \\)? Not positive.\nWhat about \\( n = -1 \\)? Not positive.\n\nThus, the only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? Let's think about \\( n \\) values that might not correspond to divisors of 39.\n\nSuppose \\( n + 2 \\) is not a divisor of 39. Does the condition still hold? According to our earlier reasoning, no, because the condition reduces to \\( k \\) dividing 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( n \\) values correspond to the \\( k \\) values that are divisors of 39 and \\( k \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the original condition?\n\nLet me think about \\( k \\) such that the entire expression is divisible by \\( k \\), but \\( k \\) does not divide 39.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\]\n\nWe can write this as:\n\\[ k(3k^2 - 9k + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide the expression, \\( k \\) must divide the term \\( k(3k^2 - 9k + 27) + 39 \\). Since \\( k \\) obviously divides the first part, \\( k \\) must divide 39 for the entire expression to be divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's double-check if there are any other possibilities.\n\n### Exploring Non-Divisor Cases Further\nSuppose \\( k \\) is such that the term \\( 3k^2 - 9k + 27 \\) cancels out the 39 when multiplied by \\( k \\) and added to 39.\n\nBut, \\( k \\) must divide the entire expression, which is \\( k \\times \\text{something} + 39 \\). For \\( k \\) to divide the entire expression, \\( k \\) must divide 39, because the other term is already divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\n### Final Verification\nLet's verify \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\):\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 3 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\n   120 is divisible by 3.\n\n2. \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\n   \\[ 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\n   Now, 130 divided by 13 is 10, so the product is divisible by 13.\n\n3. \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 39 \\]\n   \\[ 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times (1369 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\]\n   Now, 1378 divided by 39. Let's check:\n   \\[ 39 \\times 35 = 39 \\times 35 = (40 - 1) \\times 35 = 40 \\times 35 - 35 = 1400 - 35 = 1365 \\]\n   But 1378 - 1365 = 13, so 1378 is not divisible by 39. Wait, that's a problem!\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, it should work. Let's re-calculate:\n\nActually, \\( 37^2 = 1369 \\), and \\( 1369 + 9 = 1378 \\).\n\nNow, does 39 divide \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\)?\n\nFirst, factorize 39: \\( 39 = 3 \\times 13 \\).\n\nThe expression is \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\). Clearly, the 3 is accounted for. Now, does 13 divide \\( 40 \\times 1378 \\)?\n\nBut, 1378 divided by 13 is approximately 106, but \\( 13 \\times 106 = 1378 \\). Let's check:\n\\[ 13 \\times 100 = 1300 \\]\n\\[ 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\]\n\\[ 1300 + 78 = 1378 \\]\n\nThus, 1378 is divisible by 13. Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by 39, because it has both 3 and 13 as factors.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the previous calculation. Indeed, 39 divides the product because both 3 and 13 are present in the factorization of the product.\n\nThus, \\( n = 37 \\) is indeed valid.\n\n### Are There More Solutions?\nAre there any other \\( n \\) values? Let's suppose \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39, say \\( k = 39 \\times m \\), where \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), we already have \\( k = 39 \\), which gives \\( n = 37 \\).\n\nFor \\( m = 2 \\), \\( k = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\). We saw earlier that \\( k = 78 \\) does not satisfy the condition because the remainder was 13.\n\nBut according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. But 78 does not divide 39. So, \\( n = 76 \\) is not valid.\n\nThus, only \\( k \\) values that are divisors of 39 work, and the corresponding \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is it possible that for some \\( n \\), \\( n + 2 \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the original condition?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 7 \\), so \\( k = 9 \\):\nThe expression is \\( 3(9 + 1)(9^2 - 4 \\times 9 + 13) = 3 \\times 10 \\times (81 - 36 + 13) = 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 \\).\n\nNow, does 9 divide \\( 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 \\)?\n\nLet's compute \\( 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 = 30 \\times 58 = 1740 \\).\n\nNow, \\( 1740 / 9 \\approx 193.333... \\), which is not an integer. Thus, \\( n = 7 \\) does not work, as expected since 9 does not divide 39.\n\nThis confirms that only the divisors of 39 work.\n\n### Are There Negative Divisors?\nNegative divisors of 39 would lead to negative \\( n \\) values, which are invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( n \\) that we might have missed? Let's try \\( n = 3 \\), so \\( k = 5 \\):\nThe expression is \\( 3(5 + 1)(5^2 - 4 \\times 5 + 13) = 3 \\times 6 \\times (25 - 20 + 13) = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 3 \\times 108 = 324 \\).\n\nNow, does 5 divide 324? \\( 324 / 5 = 64.8 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n \\) values corresponding to \\( k \\) being a divisor of 39 work.\n\n### Summing Up the Valid \\( n \\) Values\nThe valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's double-check if there are any other divisors or cases.\n\nThe complete list of positive divisors of 39 is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)):\n\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( k = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nAre there any other divisors? Negative divisors would give negative \\( n \\), which are invalid.\n\nThus, the valid \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's see if there are more. What about larger \\( k \\) values that are not necessarily divisors of 39 but still satisfy the condition?\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but the entire expression is divisible by \\( k \\). That would require that the term \\( 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k \\) cancels out the 39 modulo \\( k \\), but as we saw, the first term is divisible by \\( k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, what if the term \\( 3k^2 - 9k + 27 \\) is not an integer? No, \\( k \\) is an integer, so the term is always an integer for integer \\( k \\).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are indeed the divisors of 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a non-trivial divisor? We've already considered all positive divisors.\n\n### Checking \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\)\nFor completeness, let's check \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), even though they lead to non-positive \\( n \\):\n\n1. \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n2. \\( k = 2 \\), \\( n = 0 \\) \u2192 invalid (since \\( n \\) must be positive).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, let's see if there are any other \\( n \\) values. Suppose \\( n = 2 \\), so \\( k = 4 \\). Does 4 divide the expression?\n\nCompute the expression for \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(5)(4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\]\n\nNow, \\( n + 2 = 4 \\). Does 4 divide 195? \\( 195 / 4 = 48.75 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\n### Final Verification\nLet's verify \\( n = 11 \\):\n\\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\nThe product is \\( 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\).\n\nNow, 130 divided by 13 is 10, and 14 is divisible by neither 3 nor 13, but the product is \\( 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\).\n\nBut, 13 is a factor of 130 (since \\( 130 = 13 \\times 10 \\)). Thus, the entire product is divisible by 13.\n\nThus, all three values work.\n\n### Summing Up\nThe sum of all valid positive integers \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this all? Let's see if there are any other \\( n \\) values.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 3 \\), \\( k = 5 \\):\nWe saw earlier that it doesn't work.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I missed something.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Polynomial Division\nPerhaps a more rigorous approach is needed. Let's consider the expression modulo \\( n + 2 \\).\n\nLet \\( k = n + 2 \\). The original condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nBut \\( n = k - 2 \\). Substitute \\( n \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\\[ n + 3 = k - 2 + 3 = k + 1 \\]\n\\[ n^2 + 9 = (k - 2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 13 \\]\n\nThus, the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division or look for patterns.\n\nBut, as before, \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\), but since \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\) might not be coprime. So, we need to ensure that \\( k \\) divides the entire expression.\n\nLet's denote:\n\\[ P(k) = 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nWe need \\( k \\mid P(k) \\).\n\nBut, \\( P(k) = 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nLet's expand \\( P(k) \\) fully to understand it better.\n\nFirst, expand \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\):\n\nLet's multiply \\( k \\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n\\[ k \\times k^2 = k^3 \\]\n\\[ k \\times (-4k) = -4k^2 \\]\n\\[ k \\times 13 = 13k \\]\n\nNow, multiply \\( 1 \\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n\\[ 1 \\times k^2 = k^2 \\]\n\\[ 1 \\times (-4k) = -4k \\]\n\\[ 1 \\times 13 = 13 \\]\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\\[ k^3 - 4k^2 + 13k + k^2 - 4k + 13 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n- \\( k^3 \\) remains.\n- \\( -4k^2 + k^2 = -3k^2 \\)\n- \\( 13k - 4k = 9k \\)\n- \\( +13 \\)\n\nThus, the product inside is:\n\\[ k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 3:\n\\[ 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\]\n\nThus, the condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid (3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39) \\]\n\nWhich is what we had before. Since \\( k \\) divides all terms except the last one, we must have:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, and as before, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) lead to positive \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are:\n1. \\( n = 1 \\) (from \\( k = 3 \\))\n2. \\( n = 11 \\) (from \\( k = 13 \\))\n3. \\( n = 37 \\) (from \\( k = 39 \\))\n\nThe sum of these values is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, I recall that sometimes there might be other solutions. Let's test \\( n = 4 \\) (i.e., \\( k = 6 \\)):\n\nCompute the product:\n\\[ 3(4 + 3)(4^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times (16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 21 \\times 25 = 525 \\]\n\nNow, \\( n + 2 = 6 \\). Does 6 divide 525? \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only the divisors of 39 give valid solutions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]\n",
        "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). After finding all such \\( n \\), I need to sum them up.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nI need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).\n\n### Approach\nI recall that if \\( d \\) divides \\( a \\), then \\( a \\mod d = 0 \\). So, \\( n+2 \\) must divide \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) completely.\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\) is a linear term, and the expression it's supposed to divide is a bit complex. Maybe I can perform polynomial division or rewrite the expression in terms of \\( n+2 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the Expression in Terms of \\( n+2 \\)\nLet me denote \\( k = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = k - 2 \\).\n\nNow, I need to rewrite \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nFirst term inside the product: \\( n + 3 = (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1 \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( n^2 + 9 = (k - 2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 13 \\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( n+2 = k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) is \\( n+2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( k \\) must be an integer \\( \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\) is positive, the smallest \\( n \\) is 1, making \\( k \\) at least 3).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Divisibility Condition\nThe condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are consecutive integers, so they are co-prime, meaning \\( \\gcd(k, k+1) = 1 \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) is a factor of the product, but since \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are co-prime, \\( k \\) must divide the remaining part of the expression.\n\nBut the expression is \\( 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\). So, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\) because \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are co-prime.\n\nBut \\( k \\) is in the denominator, and \\( k^2 \\) is in the numerator. So, we can write the condition as:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) obviously divides \\( k^2 \\), but \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\) has a \\( k^2 \\) term. Let me expand \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) modulo \\( k \\).\n\nBut \\( k^2 \\) is divisible by \\( k \\), and \\( -4k \\) is also divisible by \\( k \\). So, the remainder is just the constant term, 13.\n\nBut that's not quite right. Actually, \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 -4k \\) completely, because both terms are divisible by \\( k \\). So, the remainder comes from the constant term, which is 13.\n\nBut we have a coefficient of 3 outside. So, the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times 13 \\]\nBecause \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\), but \\( k^2 -4k \\) is divisible by \\( k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 13 \\).\n\nBut \\( k^2 -4k +13 = (k^2 -4k) + 13 \\). Since \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 -4k \\), the remainder is 13. But we have a 3 multiplied outside, so the condition reduces to:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBecause \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find Divisors of 39\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut recall that \\( k = n + 2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k \\geq 3 \\).\n\nThus, possible values for \\( k \\) are: 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut we must consider all positive divisors, but since \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\) (as \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)), we can exclude 1.\n\nBut \\( k = 1 \\) would correspond to \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are valid.\n\nBut, is \\( k = 1 \\) possible? Let's check:\n\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( n = k - 2 = -1 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive. So, \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 0 \\)? The problem says positive integers, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut, 39 has divisors: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\), so we consider \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nBut, is it possible that \\( k \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but perhaps the remainder is not just 13?\n\n### Verification\nI think I made a mistake here. The condition is \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\). But \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are co-prime, but \\( k \\) is not necessarily co-prime with the other terms.\n\nLet me re-express the condition properly.\n\nGiven that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\), and since \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are co-prime, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k^2 -4k +13 = (k^2 -4k) + 13 \\), and \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 -4k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide the remaining part, which is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nBut, is this accurate? Let's test with an example.\n\nSuppose \\( k = 3 \\). Then, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(3+1)(9 - 12 + 13) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\). But 3 divides 120, which is true. And 3 is a divisor of 39.\n\nSuppose \\( k = 13 \\). Then, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(13+1)(169 - 52 + 13) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (169 - 52 + 13) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\). But 13 must divide this product. Let's compute \\( 130 \\mod 13 \\). \\( 130 / 13 = 10 \\), so divisible. Thus, \\( k = 13 \\) works.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) doesn't divide 39? Let's try \\( k = 4 \\). Then, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(4+1)(16-16+13) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\). Does 4 divide 195? \\( 195 / 4 = 48.75 \\), no.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, only \\( k \\) values that divide 39 should work. But \\( k=4 \\) doesn't work, which is consistent since 4 is not a divisor of 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the original condition?\n\nLet's try \\( k = 9 \\). Then, the condition becomes:\n\\[ 9 \\mid 3(9+1)(81 - 36 + 13) = 3 \\times 10 \\times (81-36+13) = 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 = 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 \\]\n\nBut \\( 9 \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 \\). Let's compute \\( 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 = 30 \\times 58 = 1740 \\). Now, \\( 1740 / 9 \\approx 193.333 \\), not divisible.\n\nThis is consistent because 9 does not divide 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's try \\( k = 6 \\). Then:\n\\[ 6 \\mid 3(6+1)(36 - 24 + 13) = 3 \\times 7 \\times (36-24+13) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 525 \\]\nBut \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\), not divisible.\n\nAgain, 6 does not divide 39.\n\nThis suggests that only the divisors of 39 satisfy the condition. But, is this always true?\n\n### General Approach\nThe condition is \\( k \\mid 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are co-prime, so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k^2 -4k +13 = (k^2 -4k) + 13 \\), and \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 -4k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide the remaining term \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nBut, is it possible that \\( k \\) does not divide 39, but still divides \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\)?\n\nLet's think about it. The term \\( k^2 -4k \\) is divisible by \\( k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide the remaining term, which is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) must indeed be a divisor of 39.\n\nBut, are there other cases? What if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but the term \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) has a common factor with \\( k \\)?\n\nLet me think about \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) is the same as the GCD of \\( k \\) and \\( 13 \\), because:\n\\[ \\gcd(k, k^2 -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, -4k +13) \\] (since \\( \\gcd(k, k^2) = k \\), but we can subtract multiples of \\( k \\))\nBut \\( \\gcd(k, -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, 13) \\), because \\( \\gcd(k, -4k) = k \\), but we can use the property that \\( \\gcd(k, -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, 13) \\).\n\nThus, \\( \\gcd(k, k^2 -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, 13) \\).\n\nTherefore, the condition \\( k \\mid 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\) can be rewritten using the fact that \\( \\gcd(k, k^2 -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\). Since \\( \\gcd(k, k^2 -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, 13) \\), we can write:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\]\n\nBut, since \\( \\gcd(k, k^2 -4k +13) = \\gcd(k, 13) \\), we can consider two cases:\n\n1. If \\( \\gcd(k, 13) = 1 \\), then \\( k \\) must divide 3, because \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) are co-prime (since their GCD is 1), so \\( k \\) must divide 3.\n\n   Thus, \\( k \\) can be 1 or 3.\n\n   But \\( k \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)), so \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n2. If \\( \\gcd(k, 13) = 13 \\), then \\( k \\) is a multiple of 13. Let \\( k = 13m \\), where \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n\n   Substituting back into the condition:\n   \\[ 13m \\mid 3( (13m)^2 -4(13m) +13 ) \\]\n\n   But, \\( (13m)^2 -4(13m) +13 = 169m^2 -52m +13 = 13(13m^2 -4m +1) \\).\n\n   So, the condition becomes:\n   \\[ 13m \\mid 3 \\times 13 (13m^2 -4m +1) \\]\n   \\[ 13m \\mid 39 (13m^2 -4m +1) \\]\n\n   We can divide both sides by 13:\n   \\[ m \\mid 3 (13m^2 -4m +1) \\]\n\n   But \\( m \\) obviously divides \\( 13m^2 -4m \\), so \\( m \\) must divide the remaining term, which is \\( 3 \\times 1 \\) (since \\( 13m^2 -4m \\) is divisible by \\( m \\), leaving a remainder of 0 plus the constant term 1).\n\n   Thus:\n   \\[ m \\mid 3 \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\( m \\) can be 1 or 3 (since \\( m \\) must be a positive integer).\n\n   So, \\( k = 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\) or \\( k = 13 \\times 3 = 39 \\).\n\nBut, what about other divisors of 39? The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nFrom our analysis:\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\).\n- For \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\).\n- For \\( k = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\).\n\nBut, according to our earlier reasoning, only \\( k \\) values that are divisors of 39 are possible. And indeed, for \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\), the condition holds.\n\nBut, is there any other possibility? What if \\( k \\) shares a common factor with the other term but is not necessarily a divisor of 39?\n\nLet's test \\( k = 39 \\times t \\) where \\( t \\) is an integer. But, from our analysis, the only possible values are when \\( m \\) divides 3, leading to \\( k = 13, 39 \\) (and \\( k=3 \\) is already covered).\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not necessarily 13 or 39, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's consider \\( k = 6 \\). We saw that it didn't work, but is there any \\( k \\) not a divisor of 39 that works?\n\nSuppose \\( k = 39 \\). It works, as seen before.\n\nSuppose \\( k = 3 \\). It works.\n\nSuppose \\( k = 13 \\). It works.\n\nSuppose \\( k = 1 \\). It works, but \\( n \\) would be negative.\n\nAre there any other \\( k \\) values? Let's try \\( k = 39 \\times 2 = 78 \\). Then, the condition becomes:\n\\[ 78 \\mid 3(78^2 -4 \\times 78 +13) \\]\n\nBut, \\( 78^2 \\) is huge, but according to our earlier analysis, for \\( k = 13m \\), \\( m \\) must divide 3. So, \\( m \\) can only be 1 or 3, leading to \\( k = 13 \\) or \\( 39 \\).\n\nBut, what about \\( m = 1/3 \\)? No, \\( m \\) must be integer.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a multiple of 13? Let's consider \\( k \\) such that \\( \\gcd(k, 13) = 1 \\). Then, as before, \\( k \\) must divide 3. So, \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( 3 \\).\n\nBut \\( k =1 \\) is invalid as discussed, and \\( k=3 \\) is valid.\n\nThus, the valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 13 but not necessarily covered by our earlier analysis? For example, \\( k = 13 \\times \\) something else.\n\nBut, according to our analysis, \\( m \\) must divide 3, so \\( m \\) can be 1 or 3.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's verify:\n\n1. For \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[ 3 \\mid 3(3+1)(9-12+13) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\n   And 120 is divisible by 3.\n\n2. For \\( k = 13 \\):\n   As before, it works.\n\n3. For \\( k = 39 \\):\n   \\[ 39 \\mid 3(39+1)(39^2 -4 \\times 39 +13) \\]\n   But \\( 39^2 \\) is large, but since we've established that \\( k \\) must divide 39, and 39 is included, it must work.\n\nBut, are there other divisors? The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\n- \\( k=1 \\): invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n- \\( k=3 \\): valid.\n- \\( k=13 \\): valid.\n- \\( k=39 \\): valid.\n\nThus, the valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\nNow, recall that \\( k = n + 2 \\). So, we can find \\( n \\) for each valid \\( k \\):\n\n1. For \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[ n = k - 2 = 1 \\]\n\n2. For \\( k = 13 \\):\n   \\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\]\n\n3. For \\( k = 39 \\):\n   \\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\]\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any other \\( k \\) values. What if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the original condition?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) does not divide 39, but still satisfies \\( k \\mid 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\).\n\nLet's take \\( k = 6 \\). We saw that 6 does not divide 39, but does it satisfy the condition?\n\nCompute \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) = 3(36 - 24 + 13) = 3(25) = 75 \\). But 6 does not divide 75 (75/6 = 12.5). So, it doesn't work.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 9 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(81 - 36 + 13) = 3(58) = 174 \\). Does 9 divide 174? \\( 174 / 9 \\approx 19.333 \\). No.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 5 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(25 - 20 + 13) = 3(18) = 54 \\). Does 5 divide 54? No.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 7 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(49 - 28 + 13) = 3(34) = 102 \\). Does 7 divide 102? \\( 102 / 7 \\approx 14.571 \\). No.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 4 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(16 - 16 + 13) = 3(13) = 39 \\). Does 4 divide 39? No.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 2 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(4 - 8 + 13) = 3(9) = 27 \\). Does 2 divide 27? No.\n\nLet's try \\( k = 12 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(144 - 48 + 13) = 3(109) = 327 \\). Does 12 divide 327? \\( 327 / 12 = 27.25 \\). No.\n\nFrom these trials, it seems that only the divisors of 39 satisfy the condition.\n\nBut, according to our earlier analysis, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, i.e., 1, 3, 13, 39. And since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we consider 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what about \\( k = 39 \\times \\) something? But our analysis shows that \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39 or a multiple of 13, but only when \\( m \\) divides 3, which limits \\( k \\) to 13 and 39.\n\nBut, 3 is also valid, and it's a divisor of 39.\n\nThus, the valid \\( k \\) values are indeed 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's consider \\( k = 39 \\times 2 = 78 \\). According to our analysis, \\( m \\) would be 2, but \\( m \\) must divide 3. Since 2 does not divide 3, \\( k = 78 \\) is not valid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\n### Find Corresponding \\( n \\) Values\nNow, recall that \\( n = k - 2 \\). So:\n\n1. For \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[ n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\n2. For \\( k = 13 \\):\n   \\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\]\n\n3. For \\( k = 39 \\):\n   \\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\]\n\nNow, we need to verify that these \\( n \\) values indeed satisfy the original condition.\n\n### Verification\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 3 \\]\n   \\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(4)(1 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\n   Does 3 divide 120? Yes.\n\n2. For \\( n = 11 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\n   \\[ 3(11+3)(121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\n   Does 13 divide this? Yes, because 130 is divisible by 13 (130 = 13 \u00d7 10).\n\n3. For \\( n = 37 \\):\n   \\[ n + 2 = 39 \\]\n   \\[ 3(37+3)(37^2 + 9) \\]\n   We don't need to compute the exact value, because we know that 39 must divide this expression based on our earlier reasoning.\n\nThus, all three values are valid.\n\n### Are There More Solutions?\nWhat if \\( k \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's think about \\( k \\) such that \\( \\gcd(k, 13) = d \\), where \\( d \\) is a divisor of 13 (i.e., 1 or 13).\n\n1. If \\( d = 1 \\), then \\( k \\) must divide 3, as previously discussed. So \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( 3 \\). But \\( k=1 \\) is invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\n2. If \\( d = 13 \\), then \\( k \\) must be a multiple of 13, and as before, \\( m \\) must divide 3, leading to \\( k = 13 \\) or \\( 39 \\).\n\nThus, there are no other possibilities.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe valid positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all such positive integers \\( n \\). So, the sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? Let's think about negative divisors. However, since \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( k = n + 2 \\) must be at least 3 (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)).\n\nWhat about \\( k = 1 \\)? Then \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, we don't consider \\( k=1 \\).\n\nWhat about larger \\( k \\) values? Suppose \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39. Let's try \\( k = 39 \\times t \\), where \\( t \\) is a positive integer.\n\nBut, according to our earlier analysis, \\( m \\) must divide 3, so \\( t \\) must be such that \\( k = 13 \\times m \\), and \\( m \\) divides 3. Thus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are 13 and 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is not a multiple of 13? Then, \\( \\gcd(k, 13) = 1 \\), and \\( k \\) must divide 3. Thus, \\( k \\) can only be 3 (since \\( k=1 \\) is invalid).\n\nTherefore, the only valid \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other case? What if \\( k \\) is not necessarily related to 13, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) is arbitrary. The condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\]\n\nThis can be written as:\n\\[ k^2 -4k +13 \\equiv 0 \\mod \\frac{k}{\\gcd(k, 3)} \\]\n\nBut, perhaps it's easier to consider the equation:\n\\[ 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\]\n\nSimplify \\( 3(k^2 -4k +13) \\mod k \\):\n- \\( k^2 \\mod k = 0 \\)\n- \\( -4k \\mod k = 0 \\)\n- So, we have \\( 3(0 + 0 + 13) \\mod k \\), which is \\( 39 \\mod k \\).\n\nThus, the condition simplifies to:\n\\[ 39 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\]\nWhich means:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) must indeed be a divisor of 39.\n\n### Final Values of \\( k \\)\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( k \\geq 3 \\)). So, we consider \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n1. \\( k = 3 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 1 \\)\n2. \\( k = 13 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 11 \\)\n3. \\( k = 39 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 37 \\)\n\n### Summing Up\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this complete? What if \\( n = 0 \\)? But \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n=0 \\) is not considered.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 2 \\)? Then \\( k = 4 \\). Does 4 divide \\( 3(5)(4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\)? No, because \\( 195 / 4 = 48.75 \\).\n\nWhat about \\( n = 4 \\)? Then \\( k = 6 \\). Does 6 divide \\( 3(7)(16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 525 \\)? \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's check \\( n = 35 \\) (i.e., \\( k = 37 \\)):\n\\[ k = 37 \\]\n\\[ 3(35+3)(35^2 +9) = 3 \\times 38 \\times (1225 +9) = \\text{a large number} \\]\n\nBut, according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. Since 37 does not divide 39, \\( n = 35 \\) is not valid.\n\nThus, our initial conclusion holds.\n\n### Additional Verification\nLet's verify \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[ n + 2 = 3 \\]\n\\[ 3(1+3)(1^2 +9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\]\nAnd 120 is divisible by 3.\n\nFor \\( n = 11 \\):\n\\[ n + 2 = 13 \\]\n\\[ 3(11+3)(121 +9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\]\nAnd 13 divides 130, so the product is divisible by 13.\n\nFor \\( n = 37 \\):\n\\[ n + 2 = 39 \\]\nThe term \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\) will have \\( n^2 +9 = 37^2 +9 \\), but since \\( k = 39 \\) must divide the expression, and we've established that \\( k \\) must divide 39, it's valid.\n\n### Are There More Solutions?\nWhat if \\( n \\) is larger? Let's try \\( n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\) is already considered.\n\nWhat about \\( k = 39 \\times m \\), where \\( m \\) is an integer greater than 1.\n\nFor example, \\( k = 39 \\times 2 = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\).\n\nNow, does \\( k = 78 \\) divide \\( 3(78+1)(78^2 - 4 \\times 78 + 13) \\)?\n\nBut according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. Since 78 does not divide 39, this \\( n \\) is not valid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( k \\) that divides 39? We've already considered all positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is negative? But \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\)).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's check \\( k = 39 \\times 1 = 39 \\) is already considered.\n\nWhat about \\( k = 39 / \\) something? But 39's divisors are only 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other possibility? What if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) does not divide 39. Then, according to our earlier reasoning, the condition would not hold, because \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, is this always true? Let's test \\( k = 39 \\times \\) something.\n\nBut, in our analysis, we saw that \\( k \\) must divide 39. Therefore, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are possible.\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( k \\) that we might have missed? Let's think about \\( k \\) not necessarily related to 39.\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) is such that \\( \\gcd(k, 13) = d \\), and \\( d \\) is not necessarily 1 or 13.\n\nBut, since 13 is prime, the only possible values for \\( d \\) are 1 and 13.\n\nThus, our analysis covers all cases.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, wait! What if \\( n = 0 \\)? But \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n = 0 \\) is invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = -4 \\)? But again, \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut, just to double-check, let's see if there are any other divisors or edge cases.\n\nWhat if \\( n = 37 \\) is correct, but are there larger \\( n \\) values?\n\nLet's try \\( k = 78 \\) (i.e., \\( n = 76 \\)):\nWe need to check if 78 divides \\( 3(78^2 - 4 \\times 78 + 13) \\), but we know that \\( k \\) must divide 39, and 78 does not divide 39. Hence, it's invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is 49 the correct sum? Let's verify:\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\): valid\n2. \\( n = 11 \\): valid\n3. \\( n = 37 \\): valid\n\nSum: \\( 1 + 11 = 12 \\), \\( 12 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is 49.\n\nBut, just to ensure completeness, let's think about whether there are any other \\( k \\) values.\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's take \\( k = 39 \\times t \\), where \\( t \\) is an integer.\n\nThe condition is \\( k \\mid 39 \\), but \\( k = 39 \\times t \\), and \\( 39 \\times t \\) must divide 39 only if \\( t = 1 \\) (since for \\( t > 1 \\), \\( k = 39t \\) does not divide 39 unless \\( t \\) divides \\( \\frac{39}{39t} \\), but \\( 39t \\) divides 39 only if \\( t = 1 \\)).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k \\geq 3 \\), so \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nTherefore, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are indeed 1, 11, and 37.\n\nThus, the sum is 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, is there any other possibility? What if \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39, but the condition is still satisfied?\n\nLet's think about \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\) and 39 have a common factor, but \\( k \\) is not a divisor of 39.\n\nFor example, \\( k = 6 \\). We saw earlier that 6 does not divide 39, but does 6 divide \\( 3(6^2 -4 \\times 6 +13) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( 6^2 -4 \\times 6 +13 = 36 - 24 +13 = 25 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 25 = 75 \\). Does 6 divide 75? No.\n\nAnother example, \\( k = 9 \\):\nCompute \\( 9^2 -4 \\times 9 +13 = 81 - 36 +13 = 58 \\), and \\( 3 \\times 58 = 174 \\). Does 9 divide 174? \\( 174 / 9 \\approx 19.333 \\), no.\n\nThus, it seems that only the divisors of 39 work.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39? Let's try \\( k = 78 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(78^2 -4 \\times 78 +13) \\). But \\( 78^2 \\) is huge, but we know that \\( k \\) must divide 39. Since 78 does not divide 39, it's invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) is indeed 49.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's see if there are any other divisors or edge cases.\n\nThe complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nWe've already considered all of them except \\( k=1 \\), which gives \\( n=-1 \\) (invalid).\n\nThus, the valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is 49 indeed the correct sum? Let's verify:\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\): \\( n+2 = 3 \\) divides \\( 3(4)(10) = 120 \\), and \\( 120 / 3 = 40 \\) \u2192 valid.\n2. \\( n = 11 \\): \\( n+2 = 13 \\) divides \\( 3(14)(121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\), and \\( 130 / 13 = 10 \\) \u2192 valid.\n3. \\( n = 37 \\): \\( n+2 = 39 \\) divides \\( 3(40)(37^2 +9) \\). Since 39 divides 39, and the term is \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times (something) \\), but since 39 is part of the condition, and we've established that \\( k \\) must divide 39, it's valid.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( n \\) that might work? What if \\( n \\) is larger?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 37 + \\) something. But, as per our analysis, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39, which are limited.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, perhaps we missed something. Let's think about \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 3 \\)? Then \\( k = 5 \\). Does 5 divide \\( 3(6)(9 + 9) = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 324 \\)? 324 mod 5 = 4 \u2192 No.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 5 \\)? Then \\( k = 7 \\). Does 7 divide \\( 3(8)(25 +9) = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 816 \\)? 816 mod 7 \u2248 816 / 7 \u2248 116.571 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, it seems our initial conclusion is correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let's try \\( n = 7 \\):\nThen \\( k = 9 \\). Does 9 divide \\( 3(10)(49 +9) = 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 = 1740 \\)? 1740 mod 9 = 1740 / 9 \u2248 193.333 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 37 \\) is the largest? Let's try \\( n = 39 \\):\nThen \\( k = 41 \\). Does 41 divide \\( 3(42)(39^2 +9) \\)? This seems complex, but since 41 is not a divisor of 39, it's unlikely to work.\n\nIndeed, 41 does not divide 39, and according to our simplified condition, \\( k \\) must divide 39. Thus, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are valid.\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, is there any other possibility? What if \\( n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\) is correct, but are there others?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 39 \\times m - 2 \\). For \\( m=1 \\), \\( n=37 \\). For \\( m=2 \\), \\( n=76 \\). Does \\( n=76 \\) work?\n\nCompute \\( k = 78 \\). Does 78 divide \\( 3(78+1)(78^2 -4 \\times 78 +13) \\)?\n\nBut, as before, \\( k \\) must divide 39, and 78 does not divide 39. Hence, \\( n=76 \\) is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( k \\) that divides 39? The complete list is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n- \\( k=3 \\): \\( n=1 \\)\n- \\( k=13 \\): \\( n=11 \\)\n- \\( k=39 \\): \\( n=37 \\)\n\nAnd their sum is 49.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's check if there are any other \\( k \\) values.\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39, say \\( k = 39 \\times t \\). Then, the condition becomes:\n\\[ 39t \\mid 3(39t +1)((39t)^2 -4 \\times 39t +13) \\]\n\nThis seems complex, but our simplified condition suggests that \\( k \\) must divide 39. Thus, \\( 39t \\) must divide 39, which is only possible if \\( t = 1 \\). Therefore, the only valid \\( k \\) is 39 itself (for \\( t=1 \\)).\n\nBut, we already have \\( k=39 \\) in our list.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, is 49 the correct answer?\n\nLet me think again. The condition was simplified to \\( k \\) must divide 39. So, \\( k \\) can be any divisor of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( k \\geq 3 \\)).\n\nThus, \\( k \\) can be 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 0 \\)? Then \\( k = 2 \\). Does 2 divide \\( 3(3)(0+9) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 9 = 81 \\)? No, because 81 is odd and 2 does not divide it.\n\nBut \\( n = 0 \\) is not positive, so it's invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values correspond to \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\), giving \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, is there any other \\( k \\) that we might have missed?\n\nWhat about \\( k = 39 \\times \\) something else?\n\nFor example, \\( k = 39 \\times 2 = 78 \\), \\( n = 76 \\).\n\nNow, does 78 divide \\( 3(78+1)(78^2 -4 \\times 78 +13) \\)?\n\nFirst, compute \\( 78^2 -4 \\times 78 +13 = 78^2 - 312 +13 = 78^2 - 299 \\).\n\nBut, \\( k = 78 \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times (78^2 - 299) \\).\n\nBut, \\( k = 78 \\) must divide the whole expression.\n\nBut, \\( k^2 -4k +13 = k^2 -4k +13 \\), and \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 -4k \\), so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\), but 78 does not divide 39.\n\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion that \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39, leading to \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum is \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, looking back, is there any other \\( k \\) that divides 39? The complete list is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's check \\( k = 3 \\):\n- \\( n = 1 \\)\n\nFor \\( k = 13 \\):\n- \\( n = 11 \\)\n\nFor \\( k = 39 \\):\n- \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nAre there any other divisors? What about negative divisors? But \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( k \\geq 3 \\), and negative \\( k \\) would give negative \\( n \\), which is invalid.\n\nThus, the final answer is the sum of 1, 11, and 37, which is 49.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( k \\) that divides 39? Let's list all positive divisors of 39: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nWe've already considered all \\( k \\geq 3 \\).\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's think about whether there are any other \\( k \\) values that might work.\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) is not necessarily a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the original condition.\n\nLet's recall that the condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k+1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\]\n\nWe can expand \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) modulo \\( k \\):\n\\[ k^2 -4k +13 \\equiv 0 - 0 + 13 \\equiv 13 \\mod k \\]\n\nThus, the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k+1)(13) \\]\nBut \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are co-prime, so \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\), because \\( k \\) cannot divide \\( k+1 \\) (since \\( \\gcd(k, k+1) = 1 \\)).\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must indeed divide 39.\n\nTherefore, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the positive divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k \\geq 3 \\), so we consider 3, 13, 39.\n\nThus, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, 37, and their sum is 49.\n\n### Verification of All Cases\nLet's ensure that no other \\( n \\) values satisfy the condition.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 2 \\), \\( k = 4 \\). Does 4 divide \\( 3(5)(4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\)? 195 mod 4 = 3 \u2192 No.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 4 \\), \\( k = 6 \\). Does 6 divide \\( 3(7)(16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 525 \\)? 525 mod 6 = 525 - 6\u00d787 = 525 - 522 = 3 \u2192 No.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 5 \\), \\( k = 7 \\). Does 7 divide \\( 3(8)(25 +9) = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 816 \\)? 816 mod 7 \u2248 816 - 7\u00d7116 = 816 - 812 = 4 \u2192 No.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 6 \\), \\( k = 8 \\). Does 8 divide \\( 3(9)(36 +9) = 3 \\times 9 \\times 45 = 1215 \\)? 1215 mod 8 = 1215 / 8 = 151.875 \u2192 remainder is 1215 - 8\u00d7151 = 1215 - 1208 = 7 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) is \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's check \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive, so it's invalid.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 38 \\), \\( k = 40 \\). Does 40 divide \\( 3(41)(38^2 +9) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( 38^2 +9 = 1444 +9 = 1453 \\).\n\nNow, \\( 3 \\times 41 \\times 1453 \\). Does 40 divide this?\n\nFirst, compute \\( 3 \\times 41 \\times 1453 = 3 \\times 41 = 123 \\), then \\( 123 \\times 1453 \\). But 40 divides this product only if the product is divisible by 40.\n\nBut, \\( 123 \\times 1453 \\mod 40 \\).\n\nFirst, find \\( 123 \\mod 40 = 123 - 3 \\times 40 = 123 - 120 = 3 \\).\n\nNow, \\( 1453 \\mod 40 \\). Compute \\( 40 \\times 36 = 1440 \\), so \\( 1453 - 1440 = 13 \\).\n\nThus, the product modulo 40 is \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\mod 40 \\), which is not 0. So, 40 does not divide the product.\n\nThus, \\( n = 38 \\) is invalid.\n\nThis confirms that only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 39 \\), \\( k = 41 \\). Does 41 divide \\( 3(42)(39^2 +9) \\)?\n\nAgain, this seems complex, but since 41 does not divide 39, and our simplified condition says \\( k \\) must divide 39, this \\( n \\) is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut, looking back, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let's think about \\( n = 37 \\):\n\nFor \\( n = 37 \\), \\( k = 39 \\). Does 39 divide \\( 3(40)(37^2 +9) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( 37^2 = 1369 \\), so \\( 1369 + 9 = 1378 \\).\n\nNow, \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 = 120 \\times 1378 \\).\n\nBut 39 must divide this. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\( 120 \\times 1378 / 39 = (120 / 39) \\times 1378 \\approx 3.0769 \\times 1378 \\), which is not an integer since 120 is not divisible by 39.\n\nWait, this suggests that \\( k = 39 \\) does not divide the expression, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me re-express the condition properly.\n\nThe condition is:\n\\[ n+2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 37 \\), \\( n+2 = 39 \\), and the expression is \\( 3(40)(1378) \\).\n\nBut, \\( 39 = 3 \\times 13 \\), and \\( 3(40)(1378) \\). We can write this as:\n\\[ 39 \\times \\text{something} = 3 \\times 13 \\times \\text{something} \\]\n\nBut, does 39 divide \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\)?\n\nWe can factor out 39 from the product:\n\\[ 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 = 39 \\times ( \\frac{3 \\times 40 \\times 1378}{39} ) \\]\n\nBut, \\( 39 = 3 \\times 13 \\), so we can write:\n\\[ 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 = 3 \\times 13 \\times \\frac{3 \\times 40 \\times 1378}{3 \\times 13} = 39 \\times ( \\frac{40 \\times 1378}{13} ) \\]\n\nBut, \\( 1378 / 13 \\approx 106 \\), but \\( 1378 / 13 = 106 \\) exactly, since \\( 13 \\times 106 = 13 \\times 100 + 13 \\times 6 = 1300 + 78 = 1378 \\).\n\nThus, \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 = 39 \\times (40 \\times 106) \\), which is clearly divisible by 39.\n\nThus, \\( n = 37 \\) is indeed valid.\n\nI made a mistake in the previous calculation. Actually, 39 does divide the expression, because \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 = 39 \\times (40 \\times 106) \\), since \\( 1378 = 13 \\times 106 \\), and \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nThus, \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 = 39 \\times 40 \\times 106 \\), which is clearly divisible by 39.\n\nTherefore, \\( n = 37 \\) is indeed valid.\n\nThus, the sum remains 49.\n\n### Final Verification\nLet's verify all three cases again:\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\), \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[ 3(4)(10) = 120 \\]\n   120 / 3 = 40 \u2192 valid.\n\n2. \\( n = 11 \\), \\( k = 13 \\):\n   \\[ 3(14)(130) \\]\n   But \\( 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\). Does 13 divide this?\n   Well, 130 is divisible by 13 (130 = 13 \u00d7 10), so the entire product is divisible by 13.\n\n3. \\( n = 37 \\), \\( k = 39 \\):\n   As shown above, it's divisible by 39.\n\nThus, all three are valid, and no others seem to fit.\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, is there any other \\( n \\) that might work? What about \\( n = 39 \\times m - 2 \\) for some \\( m \\)?\n\nLet's try \\( m = 2 \\), so \\( n = 78 - 2 = 76 \\), \\( k = 78 \\).\n\nThe condition is:\n\\[ 78 \\mid 3(79)(76^2 +9) \\]\n\nBut, 78 = 39 \u00d7 2, and 39 must divide the expression, but does it?\n\nFirst, \\( 76^2 = 5776 \\), so \\( n^2 +9 = 5776 +9 = 5785 \\).\n\nNow, the expression is \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\).\n\nWe need to check if 78 divides this.\n\nFirst, factorize 78 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13.\n\nNow, the expression is \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\). Clearly, 3 is a factor, so we need to check divisibility by 2 and 13.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: The expression is \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\). 79 is odd, 5785 is odd (since 5785 ends with 5), and 3 is odd, so the product is odd \u00d7 odd \u00d7 odd = odd, which is not divisible by 2. Thus, 78 does not divide the expression, because the expression is odd and 78 is even.\n\nThis means that for \\( n = 76 \\), the condition fails because the product is not divisible by 2, and hence not divisible by 78.\n\nThis suggests that only when \\( k \\) is a divisor of 39 does the condition hold, and for multiples of 39, the condition fails because of the additional factors introduced.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( k \\) values are indeed the divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\), i.e., 3, 13, 39.\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's try \\( n = 37 + 39 = 76 \\) was invalid, as shown.\n\nThus, no other \\( n \\) values satisfy the condition.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]\n",
        "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) for which \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Finally, we need to sum all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe problem is about divisibility. Specifically, \\( n+2 \\) must divide \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the Expression\nFirst, I need to understand the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). It's a product of three terms: 3, \\( (n+3) \\), and \\( (n^2+9) \\).\n\nBut \\( n+2 \\) must divide this product. To make things easier, perhaps I can perform polynomial division or factor the expression in terms of \\( n+2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Polynomial Division or Substitution\nI recall that sometimes substitution can simplify things. Let me set \\( k = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = k - 2 \\).\n\nNow, rewrite the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\n1. \\( n + 3 = (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1 \\)\n2. \\( n^2 + 9 = (k - 2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 13 \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( n+2 = k \\), so the condition is that \\( k \\) must divide \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) divides \\( k \\) itself, but here we have \\( k \\) dividing a product. So, we need to find when \\( k \\) divides the entire expression.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Divisibility Condition\nThe condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) is a factor of the product. To understand when \\( k \\) divides the product, we can consider the following:\n\nThe term \\( k \\) is in the denominator, and the numerator is \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). However, \\( k \\) is part of the polynomial \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\), but it's not immediately clear how to simplify this.\n\nPerhaps we can perform polynomial division or factor out \\( k \\) from the numerator.\n\nBut first, let's expand the expression inside the product:\n\\[ (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nLet's expand this:\n1. Multiply \\( k \\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   \\[ k \\cdot k^2 = k^3 \\]\n   \\[ k \\cdot (-4k) = -4k^2 \\]\n   \\[ k \\cdot 13 = 13k \\]\n\n2. Multiply \\( 1 \\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   \\[ 1 \\cdot k^2 = k^2 \\]\n   \\[ 1 \\cdot (-4k) = -4k \\]\n   \\[ 1 \\cdot 13 = 13 \\]\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\\[ k^3 - 4k^2 + 13k + k^2 - 4k + 13 \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[ k^3 + (-4k^2 + k^2) + (13k - 4k) + 13 \\]\n\\[ k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\]\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\]\n\nBut we need \\( k \\) to divide this expression. So, we can write:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) obviously divides \\( k^3, k^2, \\) and \\( k \\) terms. So, the expression can be rewritten as:\n\\[ 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) = 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) must divide the entire expression. Let's see if we can factor \\( k \\) out of the expression:\n\\[ 3k^3 - 9k^2 + 27k + 39 = 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) + 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) must divide the entire expression. So, \\( k \\) must divide the remainder term when the other terms are divisible by \\( k \\). However, in this case, most terms are divisible by \\( k \\) except the constant term \\( 39 \\).\n\nBut, the expression is:\n\\[ 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\]\n\nLet's see if \\( k \\) divides \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\) plus 13.\n\nBut \\( k \\) divides \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\) because all terms have \\( k \\) as a factor. So, the condition reduces to:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times 13 \\] (since the remaining term is 13, but we have a 3 outside)\n\nWait, no. The expression is \\( 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\). The term \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\) is divisible by \\( k \\), so the entire expression modulo \\( k \\) is equivalent to \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) must divide the entire expression. Since \\( k \\) divides the first part \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\), the condition reduces to:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBecause the expression can be written as:\n\\[ 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) + 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( k \\) must divide the entire expression. Since \\( k \\) divides the first term \\( 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) \\), \\( k \\) must also divide the remaining term \\( 39 \\).\n\nTherefore, the condition simplifies to:\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( k = n + 2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( k \\) must be an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)).\n\n### Step 4: Find Divisors of 39\nFirst, factorize 39:\n\\[ 39 = 3 \\times 13 \\]\n\nNow, list all positive divisors of 39:\n\\[ 1, 3, 13, 39 \\]\n\nBut \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, the smallest \\( n \\) is 1, so \\( k \\) starts from 3).\n\nBut \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39. So, possible values for \\( k \\) are: 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut we must also consider negative divisors? No, because \\( n \\) is a positive integer, and \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\). So, negative divisors are not relevant here.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is 1? For \\( k=1 \\), \\( n = k - 2 = -1 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive. So, \\( k \\) must be \\( \\geq 3 \\).\n\nBut, \\( k=1 \\) would correspond to \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So, only \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\) are valid since \\( k=1 \\) gives \\( n=-1 \\) (invalid), and \\( k=39 \\) gives \\( n=37 \\), etc.\n\nBut, what about other divisors? The complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( k \\) must correspond to positive \\( n \\). So, for each divisor \\( k \\) of 39, we can find \\( n \\) as \\( n = k - 2 \\).\n\nLet's enumerate:\n\n1. \\( k = 1 \\)\n   \\[ n = 1 - 2 = -1 \\] \u2192 Invalid, since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\n2. \\( k = 3 \\)\n   \\[ n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\n3. \\( k = 13 \\)\n   \\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\]\n\n4. \\( k = 39 \\)\n   \\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\]\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is negative? The problem specifies positive integers \\( n \\), and \\( k = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\). So, negative \\( k \\) values are not relevant here.\n\nBut, is \\( k=1 \\) the only one that's invalid? Yes, because for \\( k=1 \\), \\( n \\) becomes negative. For all other positive divisors, \\( n \\) is positive.\n\nBut, what about larger \\( k \\) values? Are there any other divisors? No, because 39 has only four positive divisors.\n\nBut, what if \\( k \\) is larger? For example, \\( k = 78 \\) would correspond to \\( n = 76 \\), but 78 is not a divisor of 39.\n\nBut, 39 only has the divisors mentioned above. So, the valid \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? What if \\( k \\) doesn't divide 39 but still satisfies the original condition?\n\n### Verification\nThe simplification seems to suggest that \\( k \\) must divide 39. But, is this always true?\n\nLet's double-check. The original condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut, \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). To ensure accuracy, perhaps it's better to consider that \\( k \\) must divide the entire expression.\n\nBut, as we saw, the expression can be written as:\n\\[ 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) + 39 \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) divides \\( 3k(k^2 - 3k + 9) \\), it must also divide the remaining term, which is 39.\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) must indeed divide 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the positive divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( k \\) must be greater than or equal to 3 (since \\( n = k - 2 \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( k \\geq 3 \\)).\n\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( k = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nBut, what about \\( k = -1, -3, -13, -39 \\)?\n\nFor \\( k = -1 \\), \\( n = -3 \\) \u2192 invalid (negative).\nFor \\( k = -3 \\), \\( n = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid.\nAnd so on. Negative \\( k \\) values lead to negative \\( n \\) values, which are not positive integers.\n\n### Additional Cases\nBut, is it possible that other \\( k \\) values satisfy the original condition even if they don't divide 39?\n\nLet's think about it. The simplification assumed that the polynomial part is divisible by \\( k \\), but what if \\( k \\) is such that the polynomial part is not divisible by \\( k \\), but the entire expression is?\n\nLet me try to expand everything properly.\n\nThe original condition is:\n\\[ n + 2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nLet me denote \\( d = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = d - 2 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( n = d - 2 \\) into the expression:\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(d - 2 + 3)( (d-2)^2 + 9 ) \\]\n\\[ = 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9) \\]\n\\[ = 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nNow, we need \\( d \\) to divide this expression. Let's expand \\( (d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\):\n\nFirst, expand \\( (d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\):\n\\[ d \\cdot d^2 = d^3 \\]\n\\[ d \\cdot (-4d) = -4d^2 \\]\n\\[ d \\cdot 13 = 13d \\]\n\\[ 1 \\cdot d^2 = d^2 \\]\n\\[ 1 \\cdot (-4d) = -4d \\]\n\\[ 1 \\cdot 13 = 13 \\]\n\nCombine them:\n\\[ d^3 - 4d^2 + 13d + d^2 - 4d + 13 \\]\n\\[ = d^3 - 3d^2 + 9d + 13 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 3:\n\\[ 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 \\]\n\nNow, the condition is:\n\\[ d \\mid (3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39) \\]\n\nBut \\( d \\) obviously divides all terms except the constant term 39. So, we can write:\n\\[ 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 = d(3d^2 - 9d + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide the remainder when the polynomial is divided by \\( d \\), which is 39.\n\nTherefore, \\( d \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThis confirms our earlier simplification.\n\n### Find Valid \\( n \\) Values\nFrom the previous analysis, the valid \\( k \\) (which is \\( d = n + 2 \\)) values are the positive divisors of 39 that are \\( \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( n \\) must be \\( \\geq 1 \\)).\n\nBut, \\( k = d \\) must be a positive divisor of 39.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut \\( n \\) must be positive, so:\n- For \\( d = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( d = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is negative? For example, \\( d = -3 \\) \u2192 \\( n = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n\nThus, only \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\) give positive \\( n \\) values.\n\nBut, is it possible that other \\( d \\) values work? Let's test \\( d = 39 \\times m \\) where \\( m \\) is an integer. However, the condition is that \\( d \\) must divide 39, not necessarily be a multiple.\n\nBut, in general, any divisor of 39 is valid. But only those \\( d \\) values that result in positive \\( n \\) are acceptable.\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's think about non-divisors. Suppose \\( d \\) does not divide 39. Does the polynomial \\( 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 \\) get divided by \\( d \\)?\n\nFrom the previous expansion, we saw that:\n\\[ 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 = d(3d^2 - 9d + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( d \\) to divide the entire expression, it must divide the remainder term, which is 39. Therefore, \\( d \\) must indeed be a divisor of 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( d \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\n### Enumerate All Cases\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nFor each divisor \\( d \\), we can find \\( n \\) as \\( n = d - 2 \\).\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. \\( d = 1 \\)\n   \\[ n = 1 - 2 = -1 \\] \u2192 invalid (not positive).\n\n2. \\( d = 3 \\)\n   \\[ n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\] \u2192 valid.\n\n3. \\( d = 13 \\)\n   \\[ n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\] \u2192 valid.\n\n4. \\( d = 39 \\)\n   \\[ n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\] \u2192 valid.\n\nNow, are there any other divisors? Negative divisors would lead to negative \\( n \\) values, which are invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nBut, what about larger divisors? 39 is already the largest divisor. So, no more cases.\n\nBut, is 39 the only number we need to consider? What about non-integer values? The problem specifies positive integers \\( n \\), so \\( d \\) must be integers (since \\( n \\) is integer and \\( d = n + 2 \\)).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is a non-trivial divisor? Are there any others?\n\nThe complete list of positive divisors of 39 is indeed 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is not a divisor but still satisfies the condition? Let's test \\( d = 39 \\times k \\) for some \\( k \\), but \\( d \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, if \\( d \\) is a multiple of 39, say \\( d = 39k \\), then the condition becomes more complex. However, the condition is that \\( d \\) must divide 39, not the other way around.\n\nThus, only the divisors of 39 are valid.\n\nBut, is it possible that for some \\( d \\) not dividing 39, the entire expression is divisible by \\( d \\)?\n\nLet's suppose \\( d \\) does not divide 39. Then, according to our earlier analysis, \\( d \\) must divide 39 for the condition to hold. Therefore, only the divisors of 39 are valid.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's test \\( d = 0 \\), but \\( d = n + 2 \\geq 3 \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\). So, \\( d \\) must be a positive divisor of 39.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, we might have missed something. What if \\( d \\) is not a divisor of 39, but the polynomial part cancels out the 39?\n\nLet me think about specific cases.\n\nSuppose \\( d \\) is such that \\( 3d^2 - 9d + 27 \\) is divisible by \\( d \\) in a way that compensates for the 39.\n\nBut, \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 \\).\n\nBut, \\( 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d \\) is divisible by \\( d \\), so the condition reduces to \\( d \\) dividing 39.\n\nThus, our initial conclusion holds.\n\n### Check for Additional Solutions\nIs it possible that there are other \\( d \\) values not divisors of 39 that satisfy the condition?\n\nLet's suppose \\( d \\) is such that the polynomial part is not divisible by \\( d \\), but the entire expression is.\n\nBut, as shown, the expression can be written as:\n\\[ d(3d^2 - 9d + 27) + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( d \\) to divide the entire expression, \\( d \\) must divide the remainder term, which is 39. Therefore, \\( d \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( d \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive \\( n \\) values come from \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\), giving \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, we should verify these solutions to ensure correctness.\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify each candidate:\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\)\n   - \\( n + 2 = 3 \\)\n   - The expression is \\( 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\)\n   - Does 3 divide 120? Yes, because \\( 120 / 3 = 40 \\).\n\n2. \\( n = 11 \\)\n   - \\( n + 2 = 13 \\)\n   - The expression is \\( 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\)\n   - Let's compute it step by step:\n     - \\( 11^2 = 121 \\)\n     - \\( 121 + 9 = 130 \\)\n     - \\( 11 + 3 = 14 \\)\n     - Now, \\( 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 = 42 \\times 130 = 42 \\times 130 \\)\n     - But, we only need to check divisibility by 13.\n     - \\( 42 \\times 130 \\mod 13 \\)\n     - \\( 42 \\mod 13 = 3 \\) (since \\( 13 \\times 3 = 39 \\), \\( 42 - 39 = 3 \\))\n     - \\( 130 \\mod 13 = 0 \\) because \\( 130 = 13 \\times 10 \\)\n     - So, \\( 42 \\times 130 \\mod 13 = 3 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n   - Thus, 13 divides the expression.\n\n3. \\( n = 37 \\)\n   - \\( n + 2 = 39 \\)\n   - The expression is \\( 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times (1369 + 9) = 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\)\n   - To check divisibility by 39, which is \\( 3 \\times 13 \\).\n     - The expression is \\( 3 \\times 40 \\times 1378 \\).\n     - For divisibility by 13, we need to check if \\( 40 \\times 1378 \\) is divisible by 13.\n     - \\( 40 \\mod 13 = 1 \\) (since \\( 39 \\) is divisible by 13, and \\( 40 - 39 = 1 \\))\n     - Now, \\( 1378 \\mod 13 \\). Let's compute \\( 1378 / 13 \\approx 106 \\), \\( 13 \\times 106 = 1378 \\) exactly, because \\( 106 \\times 13 = 106 \\times 10 + 106 \\times 3 = 1060 + 318 = 1378 \\).\n     - So, \\( 1378 \\) is divisible by 13.\n     - Thus, \\( 40 \\times 1378 \\) is divisible by 13 (since 1378 is divisible by 13).\n   - Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by both 3 and 13, hence by 39.\n\nThus, all three candidates satisfy the condition.\n\n### Are There More Solutions?\nAre there any other divisors of 39? The complete list of positive divisors is 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\n- For \\( d = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( d = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nAre there any other positive divisors? No, because 39 is \\( 3 \\times 13 \\), and its divisors are only the combinations of its prime factors.\n\nBut, what about non-positive divisors? Negative divisors would lead to negative \\( n \\) values, which are invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, and 37.\n\n### Summing Up the Solutions\nNow, we need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this all? What if there are larger \\( n \\) values?\n\nLet's think about larger \\( n \\) values. Suppose \\( d \\) is not a divisor of 39 but still satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's suppose \\( d \\) is arbitrary. The condition is:\n\\[ d \\mid 39 \\]\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is such that the polynomial part compensates for the 39?\n\nLet me think about the general condition.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nFor \\( d \\) to divide this expression, since \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( d \\) must divide the product \\( 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nBut, \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), but since \\( d \\) and \\( d + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d^2 - 4d + 13)(d + 1) \\), but \\( d \\) is coprime with \\( d + 1 \\).\n\nHowever, \\( d \\) may share factors with the other terms.\n\nBut, perhaps it's easier to consider that \\( d \\) must divide the constant term 39 when considering the polynomial modulo \\( d \\).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( d \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps there are other \\( d \\) values that work.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 2 \\), \\( d = 4 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(2 + 3)(4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\)\n- Does 4 divide 195? \\( 195 / 4 = 48.75 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 3 \\), \\( d = 5 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(3 + 3)(9 + 9) = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 3 \\times 108 = 324 \\)\n- Does 5 divide 324? \\( 324 / 5 = 64.8 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 4 \\), \\( d = 6 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(4 + 3)(16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 3 \\times 175 = 525 \\)\n- Does 6 divide 525? \\( 525 / 6 = 87.5 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 5 \\), \\( d = 7 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(5 + 3)(25 + 9) = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 3 \\times 8 \\times 34 = 3 \\times 272 = 816 \\)\n- Does 7 divide 816? \\( 816 / 7 \\approx 116.571 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 6 \\), \\( d = 8 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(6 + 3)(36 + 9) = 3 \\times 9 \\times 45 = 3 \\times 9 \\times 45 = 27 \\times 45 = 1215 \\)\n- Does 8 divide 1215? \\( 1215 / 8 = 151.875 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 7 \\), \\( d = 9 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(7 + 3)(49 + 9) = 3 \\times 10 \\times 58 = 30 \\times 58 = 1740 \\)\n- Does 9 divide 1740? Sum of digits of 1740 is 12, which is not divisible by 9 \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 8 \\), \\( d = 10 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(8 + 3)(64 + 9) = 3 \\times 11 \\times 73 = 33 \\times 73 = 33 \\times 70 + 33 \\times 3 = 2310 + 99 = 2409 \\)\n- Does 10 divide 2409? Ends with 9 \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 9 \\), \\( d = 11 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(9 + 3)(81 + 9) = 3 \\times 12 \\times 90 = 36 \\times 90 = 3240 \\)\n- Does 11 divide 3240? Let's check \\( 3240 / 11 \\approx 294.545 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 10 \\), \\( d = 12 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(10 + 3)(100 + 9) = 3 \\times 13 \\times 109 = 39 \\times 109 \\)\n  - \\( 39 \\times 109 = (40 - 1) \\times 109 = 40 \\times 109 - 109 = 4360 - 109 = 4251 \\)\n- Does 12 divide 4251? \\( 4251 / 12 = 354.25 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nFrom these trials, it seems that only the \\( n \\) values corresponding to the divisors of 39 work.\n\nBut, just to be sure, let's try \\( n = 14 \\) (next potential candidate if we consider larger numbers).\n\nFor \\( n = 14 \\), \\( d = 16 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(14 + 3)(14^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 17 \\times (196 + 9) = 3 \\times 17 \\times 205 \\)\n- Calculate \\( 17 \\times 205 = 17 \\times (200 + 5) = 3400 + 85 = 3485 \\)\n- Now, \\( 3 \\times 3485 = 10455 \\)\n- Does 16 divide 10455? \\( 10455 / 16 \\approx 653.4375 \\) \u2192 No.\n\nThis suggests that only the \\( n \\) values derived from the divisors of 39 satisfy the condition.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 0 \\)? But \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, is there a possibility of larger \\( n \\) values? Let's try \\( n = 37 \\) is already included.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 36 \\), \\( d = 38 \\)\n- Expression: \\( 3(36 + 3)(36^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 39 \\times (1296 + 9) = 3 \\times 39 \\times 1305 \\)\n- We need \\( 38 \\) to divide this expression.\n- But, 38 = 2 \u00d7 19. Does the expression have both factors?\n  - The expression is \\( 3 \\times 39 \\times 1305 \\).\n  - 39 is divisible by 13 and 3, but 38 requires 2 and 19.\n  - Check divisibility by 19: \\( 3 \\times 39 \\times 1305 \\mod 19 \\).\n    - First, find \\( 39 \\mod 19 \\). Since \\( 19 \\times 2 = 38 \\), \\( 39 \\mod 19 = 1 \\).\n    - Now, \\( 1305 \\mod 19 \\). Let's compute \\( 19 \\times 68 = 1292 \\), \\( 1305 - 1292 = 13 \\).\n    - So, the expression modulo 19 is \\( 3 \\times 1 \\times 13 = 39 \\mod 19 \\). But \\( 39 \\mod 19 = 1 \\) (since 39 - 19 = 20, 20 - 19 = 1). No, 39 mod 19 is 1? Let's see: 19 \u00d7 2 = 38, 39 - 38 = 1. So, 39 \u2261 1 mod 19.\n    - Thus, the expression modulo 19 is \\( 3 \\times 1 \\times 13 \\mod 19 = 39 \\mod 19 = 1 \\).\n    - Since the remainder is 1, 19 does not divide the expression.\n  - Therefore, 38 does not divide the expression.\n\nThus, only the \\( n \\) values corresponding to the divisors of 39 seem to work.\n\n### Final Verification\nLet's ensure that no other \\( n \\) values work. Suppose \\( n \\) is such that \\( d = n + 2 \\) is not a divisor of 39. Then, \\( d \\) does not divide 39, and since the polynomial part is divisible by \\( d \\), \\( d \\) must divide 39 for the entire expression to be divisible by \\( d \\).\n\nThus, the only possible \\( n \\) values correspond to the positive divisors of 39 that result in positive \\( n \\), i.e., \\( d = 3, 13, 39 \\).\n\nBut, what if \\( d \\) is a multiple of 39? Let's try \\( d = 78 \\) (i.e., \\( n = 76 \\)):\n\n- Expression: \\( 3(76 + 3)(76^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 79 \\times (5776 + 9) = 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\)\n- Does 78 divide this expression? 78 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13.\n  - The expression has a factor of 3 (from the initial 3).\n  - It has a factor of 13? We need to check if \\( 79 \\times 5785 \\) is divisible by 13.\n    - First, \\( 79 \\mod 13 \\). \\( 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\), so \\( 79 \\mod 13 = 1 \\).\n    - Now, \\( 5785 \\mod 13 \\). Let's compute \\( 13 \\times 445 = 5785 \\) (since \\( 13 \\times 400 = 5200 \\), \\( 13 \\times 45 = 585 \\), \\( 5200 + 585 = 5785 \\)).\n    - So, \\( 5785 \\) is divisible by 13.\n  - Thus, the expression is divisible by 3 and 13, but we need to check for divisibility by 78, which also requires divisibility by 2.\n    - The expression is \\( 3 \\times 79 \\times 5785 \\). For divisibility by 2, we need the product to be even.\n    - \\( 79 \\) is odd, \\( 5785 \\) is odd (ends with 5), and 3 is odd. So, the product is odd and not divisible by 2.\n    - Thus, 78 does not divide the expression.\n\nThis confirms that only the divisors of 39 themselves work, not their multiples.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are those derived from the positive divisors of 39 that result in positive \\( n \\), i.e., \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nBut, we need to ensure completeness. Are there any other divisors?\n\nThe complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\n- For \\( d = 1 \\), \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n- For \\( d = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\) \u2192 valid.\n- For \\( d = 39 \\), \\( n = 37 \\) \u2192 valid.\n\nThus, the valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 0 \\)? \\( n \\) must be positive, so \\( n = 0 \\) is invalid.\n\n### Summing Up\nThe sum of all valid positive integers \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is this exhaustive? Let's think about \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n \\) must be positive.\n\nWhat about \\( n = -4 \\)? Not positive.\n\nThus, the only valid positive integers are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 38 \\)? Let's test \\( n = 38 \\), \\( d = 40 \\).\n\n- Expression: \\( 3(38 + 3)(38^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 41 \\times (1444 + 9) = 3 \\times 41 \\times 1453 \\)\n- Does 40 divide this? For 40 to divide the expression, the expression must be divisible by 8 and 5 (since 40 = 8 \u00d7 5).\n\nFirst, check divisibility by 5:\n- The last digit of the product \\( 3 \\times 41 \\times 1453 \\) depends on the last digits of the components.\n- \\( 3 \\times 41 \\times 1453 \\):\n  - Last digit of 41 is 1.\n  - Last digit of 1453 is 3.\n  - So, last digit of \\( 41 \\times 1453 \\) is \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\).\n  - Then, multiply by 3 \u2192 last digit is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n- The last digit is 9, so the number modulo 5 is 4 (since 9 mod 5 is 4). But, for divisibility by 5, the last digit must be 0 or 5. Thus, it's not divisible by 5, and hence not by 40.\n\nThus, \\( n = 38 \\) does not work.\n\nThis further confirms that only the \\( n \\) values derived from the divisors of 39 work.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is there any other \\( n \\) value? Let's try \\( n = 3 \\), which was not in our list.\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\), \\( d = 5 \\):\n- Expression: \\( 3(3 + 3)(9 + 9) = 3 \\times 6 \\times 18 = 324 \\)\n- Does 5 divide 324? 324 \u00f7 5 = 64.8 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) work.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 2 \\), \\( d = 4 \\):\n- Expression: \\( 3(2 + 3)(4 + 9) = 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195 \\)\n- Does 4 divide 195? 195 \u00f7 4 = 48.75 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only the previous three values work.\n\nBut, what if \\( n = 4 \\), \\( d = 6 \\):\n- Expression: \\( 3(4 + 3)(16 + 9) = 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 525 \\)\n- Does 6 divide 525? 525 \u00f7 6 = 87.5 \u2192 No.\n\nThus, only \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\) are valid.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 10 \\), \\( d = 12 \\):\n- Expression: \\( 3(10 + 3)(100 + 9) = 3 \\times 13 \\times 109 = 4251 \\) (as before)\n- Does 12 divide 4251? 4251 \u00f7 12 \u2248 354.25 \u2192 No.\n\nThis suggests that our initial conclusion is correct.\n\nBut, is there any other \\( d \\) that is not a divisor of 39 but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet's think about \\( d \\) such that \\( d \\) divides the polynomial part plus 39.\n\nBut, in our earlier analysis, we saw that \\( d \\) must divide 39 because the polynomial part is divisible by \\( d \\), leaving the remainder 39.\n\nThus, the only possible \\( d \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nTherefore, the only positive \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 0 \\)? The problem specifies positive integers, so \\( n = 0 \\) is not considered.\n\n### Are There More Solutions?\nLet's consider \\( d \\) values that are not divisors of 39 but still satisfy the condition.\n\nSuppose \\( d \\) is such that the polynomial part is not divisible by \\( d \\), but the entire expression is.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 \\]\n\nFor \\( d \\) to divide this, we can write:\n\\[ 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d + 39 \\equiv 0 \\mod d \\]\nBut, \\( 3d^3 - 9d^2 + 27d \\) is divisible by \\( d \\), so the condition reduces to:\n\\[ 0 + 39 \\equiv 0 \\mod d \\]\nWhich means:\n\\[ d \\mid 39 \\]\n\nThus, the only possible \\( d \\) values are indeed the divisors of 39.\n\n### Final Summation\nTherefore, the only valid positive integers \\( n \\) are those derived from the positive divisors of 39 that are greater than or equal to 3 (to ensure \\( n \\) is positive).\n\n- \\( d = 3 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 1 \\)\n- \\( d = 13 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 11 \\)\n- \\( d = 39 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nThe sum of these \\( n \\) values is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, is there any other \\( d \\) value? What about \\( d = 39 \\times k \\) for some integer \\( k \\)?\n\nLet's try \\( d = 78 \\) (i.e., \\( k = 2 \\)):\n- Then, \\( n = d - 2 = 76 \\).\n- We already checked \\( n = 76 \\) (which corresponds to \\( d = 78 \\)) and saw that 78 does not divide the expression.\n\nThus, no other solutions exist beyond the ones we've found.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps there's a larger \\( n \\) that works.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 36 \\), \\( d = 38 \\):\n- Expression: \\( 3(36 + 3)(36^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 39 \\times (1296 + 9) = 3 \\times 39 \\times 1305 \\)\n- Does 38 divide this? We saw earlier that 38 doesn't divide the expression because it's not divisible by 2.\n\nThus, only the initial three values work.\n\n### Are There Any Other Divisors?\nThe complete list of positive divisors of 39 is: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nWe've already considered all of them except \\( d = 1 \\), which gives \\( n = -1 \\) (invalid).\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nBut, what about \\( n = 38 \\) (i.e., \\( d = 40 \\))? We saw that it didn't work.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter thorough analysis, the only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nTherefore, the sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\]\n\nBut, just to ensure completeness, perhaps we should consider \\( n = 0 \\), but since \\( n \\) must be positive, it's excluded.\n\nWhat about \\( n = 38 \\)? We saw that it doesn't work.\n\nThus, the only valid \\( n \\) values are 1, 11, and 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut, is there a possibility of larger \\( n \\) values?\n\nLet's try \\( n = 37 + 39 = 76 \\) (just a wild guess, but it's not systematic).\n\nBut, as shown earlier, \\( n = 76 \\) does not work.\n\nThus, it seems that only the \\( n \\) values corresponding to the divisors of 39 work.\n\nBut, is 49 the correct sum?\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\nWe have:\n1. \\( d = 3 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 1 \\)\n2. \\( d = 13 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 11 \\)\n3. \\( d = 39 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nSum: \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, what about \\( d = 1 \\)? \\( n = -1 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n\nAre there any other divisors? No, because 39 is \\( 3 \\times 13 \\), and its only positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nThus, the sum is indeed 49.\n\nBut, is there any other possibility? What if \\( n + 2 \\) is not a divisor of 39, but still satisfies the condition?\n\nLet me think about the general case. The condition is:\n\\[ n + 2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nLet me denote \\( k = n + 2 \\). Then, as before, the condition becomes:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut, as we've seen, \\( k \\) must divide 39.\n\nBut, is this always true? Let me think about the general case.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) to divide this expression, since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide the product of the remaining terms.\n\nBut, \\( k \\) is not necessarily coprime with \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\). So, perhaps the condition is more complex.\n\nLet me expand \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\):\n\nWe already did this expansion earlier, resulting in:\n\\[ k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13 \\]\n\nThus, the condition is:\n\\[ k \\mid 3(k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k + 13) \\]\n\nBut, \\( k \\) divides \\( k^3 - 3k^2 + 9k \\), so the condition reduces to:\n\\[ k \\mid 3 \\times 13 \\]\n\\[ k \\mid 39 \\]\n\nThus, the only possible \\( k \\) values are the divisors of 39.\n\nTherefore, our initial conclusion is correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThus, the only positive integers \\( n \\) correspond to \\( k = 3, 13, 39 \\), giving \\( n = 1, 11, 37 \\).\n\nSum: \\( 1 + 11 + 37 = 49 \\).\n\nBut, is there any other \\( k \\) that we might have missed?\n\nWhat about \\( k = -3, -13, -39 \\)?\n\nFor \\( k = -3 \\), \\( n = -5 \\) \u2192 invalid.\nFor \\( k = -13 \\), \\( n = -15 \\) \u2192 invalid.\nFor \\( k = -39 \\), \\( n = -41 \\) \u2192 invalid.\n\nThus, only the positive divisors of 39 give valid positive \\( n \\) values.\n\nBut, what about \\( k = 39 \\times m \\) for some integer \\( m \\)?\n\nFor example, \\( k = 78 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 76 \\). We saw that this doesn't work because the expression is not divisible by \\( k \\) in that case.\n\nThus, only the divisors themselves work.\n\nBut, is it possible for a larger \\( k \\) to satisfy the condition?\n\nLet's suppose \\( k \\) is a multiple of 39, say \\( k = 39 \\times m \\). Then, the condition becomes:\n\\[ 39m \\mid 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\]\n\nBut, unless \\( (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\) compensates to make the entire expression divisible by \\( 39m \\), it's unlikely.\n\nLet's test \\( k = 78 \\) (\\( m = 2 \\)):\n- The expression is \\( 3(78 + 1)(78^2 - 4 \\times 78 + 13) \\)\n- But, we already saw that for \\( n = 76 \\), the expression was not divisible by 78.\n\nThus, only the divisors of 39 themselves work.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]\n"

        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and then sum all those n's. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. So mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nWhich means that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is a multiple of n + 2. To find all such positive integers n, I need to find all n where this congruence holds.\n\nOne approach to solve such divisibility problems is to use the concept of modular arithmetic. Specifically, since we are dealing with modulus n + 2, we can substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). That substitution might help simplify the expression.\n\nLet me try that. If n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), then we can substitute n with -2 in the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) and set it congruent to 0 mod (n + 2). Let's compute that:\n\nFirst, compute each part:\n\nn + 3 \u2261 (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2)\n\nn\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 (-2)\u00b2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2)\n\nTherefore, substituting into the original expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod (n + 2)\n\nSo, we have that 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Which means that n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39.\n\nWait, since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies n + 2 \u2265 3). So all positive divisors of 39 that are greater than or equal to 3.\n\nBut first, let's list all positive divisors of 39. The prime factorization of 39 is 3 * 13. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, and 39. However, as n + 2 must be at least 3, we exclude 1. So possible values of n + 2 are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n can be:\n\nn + 2 = 3 \u21d2 n = 1\n\nn + 2 = 13 \u21d2 n = 11\n\nn + 2 = 39 \u21d2 n = 37\n\nWait, but hold on. The modulus here is n + 2, so when we substituted n \u2261 -2, we found that n + 2 divides 39, so n + 2 must be a divisor of 39. So n + 2 \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39}, but since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3. So n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. Then, the sum would be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. But wait, before jumping to conclusion, is that all?\n\nWait a second, but sometimes when you use this substitution, you might miss something? Or maybe not? Let me verify.\n\nLet me recall that if we have a polynomial P(n) and we want to find when P(n) is divisible by n + 2, then by the Remainder Factor Theorem, the remainder when P(n) is divided by n + 2 is P(-2). Therefore, in our problem, we have P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, the remainder when P(n) is divided by n + 2 is equal to P(-2) = 3(1)(13) = 39, as above. Therefore, n + 2 divides P(n) if and only if n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, our reasoning is correct, and n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39 greater or equal to 3, hence divisors 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me test these n's in the original expression to make sure.\n\nFirst, n = 1:\n\nCheck if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120.\n\nIndeed, 120 divided by 3 is 40, so yes, 3 divides 120. Good.\n\nn = 11:\n\nn + 2 = 13.\n\nCompute 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130.\n\nCompute this: 3*14 = 42, 42*130 = 5460.\n\nCheck if 5460 is divisible by 13. Let's divide 5460 by 13.\n\n13*420 = 5460. Yes, exactly. So 13 divides 5460. Good.\n\nn = 37:\n\nn + 2 = 39.\n\nCompute 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378.\n\nCompute 3*40 = 120, 120*1378 = 165,360.\n\nCheck if 165,360 is divisible by 39.\n\nWell, 39 = 13*3. Let's check divisibility by 3: 1+6+5+3+6+0 = 21, which is divisible by 3, so yes. Then check divisibility by 13.\n\nAlternatively, divide 165360 by 39:\n\nCompute 39*4000 = 156,000\n\n165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360\n\n39*240 = 9,360\n\nSo total is 4000 + 240 = 4240. Therefore, 39*4240 = 165,360. So yes, divisible.\n\nTherefore, all three n's work. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait again. Wait, but 39 is a divisor of 39, but in the problem statement, we have 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9). So the 3 is multiplied in front. But in our calculation, we considered divisors of 39, which includes the 3 already. Hmm, but our calculation seems correct because we used the remainder theorem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the remainder when P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divided by n + 2 is equal to P(-2) = 3*(1)*(13) = 39, so n + 2 divides P(n) iff n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, even though there's a factor of 3 in front, since we're computing the remainder, which is 39, which is 3*13, the same as the divisors. So our reasoning is okay.\n\nBut wait, perhaps n + 2 divides 39, but since 39 has prime factors 3 and 13, but n + 2 could also be divisors of 39 multiplied by factors in the expression? Wait, no, because according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, regardless of the factors in the original expression, n + 2 must divide 39. Therefore, only 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So n + 2 divides 39, but is that necessarily true? Wait, according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, yes, n + 2 must divide 39. So that should be all the divisors.\n\nBut wait, another way: Suppose that d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Then substitute into the expression:\n\nWe have d divides 3(d - 2 + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nd divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nTherefore, d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since d divides this product, then d must divide any linear combination of d and the other terms. Wait, but maybe using gcd properties.\n\nSince d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), then gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, because consecutive integers. Similarly, gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = gcd(d, 13). Let me check:\n\ngcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = gcd(d, (d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) - d*(d - 4)) = gcd(d, 13). So yes, gcd(d,13). Therefore, gcd(d, 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)) = gcd(d, 3*1*13) = gcd(d, 39). So since d divides 3* (d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), and gcd(d, (d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)) divides gcd(d, 39), so in order for d to divide the product, all prime factors of d must divide 3* gcd(d, 39). Hmm, perhaps this approach complicates things.\n\nBut according to the Remainder Theorem approach, since we have that d divides 39, so d | 39. So that approach seems straightforward and correct, leading us to d \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, hence n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}, sum 49.\n\nBut wait, here's a catch: Suppose d divides 39. Then d is 1, 3, 13, 39, but since d = n + 2 \u2265 3, n positive integer. So that gives n = 1, 11, 37. But wait, but let's check if maybe there are other divisors when considering that 3 and d might have common factors?\n\nWait, if d divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), but according to Remainder Theorem, we have that d divides 39. Therefore, regardless of the factors, the necessary and sufficient condition is that d divides 39. Therefore, unless our application of the Remainder Theorem was flawed.\n\nWait, but the Remainder Theorem states that the remainder when P(n) is divided by n - a is P(a). So in our case, divisor is n + 2 = n - (-2), so remainder is P(-2). Then, n + 2 divides P(n) iff P(-2) \u2261 0 mod n + 2. Which is equivalent to n + 2 divides P(-2). Since P(-2) = 39, we have n + 2 divides 39. So yes, this is a theorem, so this must be correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that n + 2 must be a divisor of 39 is correct, hence n + 2 \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, leading to n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. But wait, but wait another thought: 39 has divisors also negative ones, but since n is positive, n + 2 is positive, so we only consider positive divisors.\n\nWait, but here's a problem. Suppose d divides 39, so d could be any of \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b113, \u00b139, but since d = n + 2 > 0, only positive divisors. So our previous conclusion holds.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Let me check n=2. Wait n=2, n+2=4. 4 divides 3*(5)*(4 +9)= 3*5*13=195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75, which is not integer. So n=2 is invalid, which is not in our list. How about n=4? n+2=6. Check if 6 divides 3*(7)*(16 +9)=3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5, nope. Not integer. How about n=5? n+2=7. Check 3*8*(25 +9)=3*8*34=816. 816 /7 \u2248 116.57, not integer.\n\nBut according to our previous logic, n + 2 must divide 39, so n + 2 must be 3,13,39, so n=1,11,37, which all work, but are there any other n's?\n\nWait, but let's suppose that n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 must be a divisor of 39, but in the problem statement, we have 3 multiplied in front. So if n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9), but since n + 2 divides 39, which is 3*13, but could there be a case where n + 2 shares a factor with 3 or 13, but not necessarily divides 39? Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem, we have that n + 2 divides 39. So regardless of the factors, n + 2 must divide 39. Therefore, unless the Remainder Theorem is not applicable here.\n\nWait, but the Remainder Theorem is applicable here because we're dealing with integer divisibility. Let me confirm with another example. Suppose n + 2 divides P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, n + 2 divides P(n) if and only if P(n) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Since n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), then P(n) \u2261 P(-2) mod (n + 2). Therefore, P(-2) must be \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides P(-2). Since P(-2) = 39, n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, this is a solid conclusion.\n\nTherefore, unless there is a mistake in calculation of P(-2). Let's recalculate:\n\nCompute P(-2) = 3*(-2 + 3)*((-2)^2 + 9) = 3*(1)*(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nTherefore, conclusion is correct. So n + 2 divides 39, so n + 2 \u2208 {3,13,39}, n \u2208 {1,11,37}, sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me check n=4 again. Wait n=4, n+2=6. Then 6 divides 3*(4 + 3)*(16 + 9) = 3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5, which is not integer, so n=4 is invalid, which is correct. Similarly, n=5: n+2=7, 3*8*34=816, 816/7\u2248116.57, not integer.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 is 3,13,39, but 39's divisors also include 3*13=39. But what if n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9), but since n + 2 and n + 3 are coprime? Let's see:\n\ngcd(n + 2, n + 3) = gcd(n + 2, 1) = 1. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Similarly, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute that:\n\ngcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9 - n*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9 + 2*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, 13). Therefore, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) divides 13.\n\nTherefore, putting this all together:\n\nWe have n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9), and since gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, since gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) divides 13, n + 2 divides 3*13 = 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Which is the same conclusion as before. Therefore, this confirms our previous result.\n\nTherefore, n + 2 must be a divisor of 39, so n + 2 \u2208 {1,3,13,39}, but n positive integer, so n \u2208 {1,11,37}, sum 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the gcd approach, we have n + 2 divides 3*13, so n + 2 divides 39, which is the same conclusion. Therefore, this seems solid.\n\nBut here's another check. Let's suppose n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 could be 3, 13, 39. Let's check if there are any other divisors. Wait, 39 is 3*13, so divisors are 1,3,13,39. So that's all. So n + 2 can't be anything else.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, it's the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So even though n + 2 divides 39, but if n + 2 shares a factor with 3 or something else... Wait, but according to the logic above, even if n + 2 has a common factor with 3 or 13, but since n + 2 divides 39, which is 3*13, all factors are considered. So even if n + 2 is 3, which divides 3, or 13 divides 13, or 39 divides both.\n\nBut let's take n=1, n + 2=3. Then 3 divides 3*(4)*(1 + 9)= 3*4*10, obviously yes. Similarly n=11, n + 2=13 divides 3*14*(121 + 9)=3*14*130. Since 130 is divisible by 13, yes. And n=37, n + 2=39 divides 3*40*(1369 + 9)=3*40*1378. 1378 divided by 13 is 106, since 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, so 1300 + 78=1378. Therefore, 1378=13*106, so 3*40*13*106 = 39*40*106, which is divisible by 39. So all three n's work.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me check n=0. Wait, n must be positive integer, so n=0 is invalid. How about n=37, which we checked. Seems okay.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. So n + 2 could be 3, 13, 39, but what if n + 2 divides 39 but in reality, due to some cancellation or something, even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39, but divides the product? Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem, we have that n + 2 divides P(n) iff n + 2 divides P(-2)=39, so regardless of the product's structure, the divisibility is equivalent to n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there can't be more solutions. So unless the Remainder Theorem is not applicable here.\n\nWait, but the Remainder Theorem works over polynomials. In integers, we can use the same idea because if we think of P(n) as a polynomial, then P(n) \u2261 0 mod d where d = n + 2. Since n \u2261 -2 mod d, substituting gives P(-2) \u2261 0 mod d, so d divides P(-2). So this is a valid method in integer divisibility problems.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: only n=1,11,37. Sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me check n=4 again. Wait n=4, n + 2=6. Then 6 divides 3*(7)*(16 + 9)=3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5. Not integer. So n=4 not a solution, which is correct.\n\nWait n=5: n + 2=7. 3*8*34=816. 816 /7 is 116.571..., not integer.\n\nWait n=7: n + 2=9. 3*10*(49 + 9)=3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.333... Not integer.\n\nWait n=10: n + 2=12. 3*13*(100 + 9)=3*13*109=4251. 4251 /12=354.25, nope.\n\nWait n=13: n + 2=15. 3*16*(169 + 9)=3*16*178=8544. 8544 /15=569.6, not integer.\n\nWait n=14: n + 2=16. 3*17*(196 + 9)=3*17*205=10455. 10455 /16\u2248653.4375, nope.\n\nWait n=2: n + 2=4. 3*5*13=195. 195 /4=48.75, not integer.\n\nWait n=3: n + 2=5. 3*6*(9 + 9)=3*6*18=324. 324 /5=64.8, not integer.\n\nSo all the numbers between 1 and, say, 15, except 1,11,37, do not work. So seems like our list is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me check n= -1. Wait, n must be positive. So n=-1 invalid.\n\nWait, n=37: works. Next divisor of 39 is 39 itself. So n + 2=39, n=37. Then next would be 39* something? But 39 is the largest divisor.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39. So n + 2 can't be anything else.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 could be 3,13,39. But 39 is 3*13, so if n + 2 is 3, then gcd(3,3)=3, but in our problem, we have 3 multiplied in front. Is there a case where n + 2 divides the product only partially through the 3 factor?\n\nBut according to our previous analysis using gcd, n + 2 divides 39 regardless. So even if n + 2 divides the 3 factor or the other factors, the conclusion that n + 2 divides 39 still holds. So seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Since gcd(n + 2, n + 3)=1, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, as gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) divides 13, so n + 2 divides 3*13=39. So same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I think our answer is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me check n=1 again. n=1: n + 2=3. Then 3 divides 3*(4)*(1 + 9)= 3*4*10. Yes, obviously. So 3 divides 120. Good.\n\nWait n=11: n + 2=13 divides 3*14*130. Since 130 is divisible by 13, yes.\n\nn=37: n + 2=39 divides 3*40*1378. Since 1378=13*106, so 3*40*13*106=39*40*106, which is divisible by 39.\n\nSo all three work. So unless there are other divisors of 39 that we haven't considered. Wait, 39 is 3*13, both primes, so divisors are indeed 1,3,13,39.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\". So the product is three times (n + 3) times (n squared + 9). So in case n + 2 divides this product. So according to our analysis, only n + 2 divides 39. So unless there is a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, but let's suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Substitute into the expression:\n\n3(d - 2 + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nWe need d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) divides 13 as we saw earlier.\n\nTherefore, d divides 3 * 1 * gcd(d,13). So:\n\nIf 13 divides d, then gcd(d,13)=13, so d divides 3 * 13 = 39.\n\nIf 13 does not divide d, gcd(d,13)=1, so d divides 3*1=3.\n\nTherefore, d divides 39. Which again leads us to d | 39, so d \u2208 {1,3,13,39}, leading to n \u2208 {1,11,37}.\n\nTherefore, this method also gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: the only positive integers n are 1, 11, 37, sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Let me check n= -5. No, n must be positive. So seems like all possibilities exhausted.\n\nWait, but wait another check. Let's take d=3:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) when d=3:\n\n3 divides 3*(4)*(9 -12 +13)= 3*4*10=120. Yes.\n\nd=13:\n\nCheck if 13 divides 3*(14)*(169 - 52 +13)= 3*14*130. 130 is divisible by 13.\n\nd=39:\n\nCheck if 39 divides 3*(40)*(1521 - 156 +13)= 3*40*(1521 - 156 +13). Wait, 1521 - 156 = 1365, 1365 +13=1378. 1378 /13=106, so 1378=13*106. Then 3*40*13*106 = 39*40*106, which is divisible by 39.\n\nSo all three divisors work.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 49.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\". So the product is three times (n + 3) times (n squared + 9). So in case n + 2 divides this product, so according to our analysis, n + 2 divides 39, so n + 2 is 3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. So sum is 49.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Let me check n=1 again. n=1: product is 3*(4)*(1 + 9)= 3*4*10=120. n + 2=3. 120 /3=40. Integer. Good.\n\nn=11: product=3*(14)*(121 + 9)=3*14*130=5460. 5460 /13=420. Integer.\n\nn=37: product=3*(39 +1=40)*( (37)^2 +9)=3*40*1378=165360. 165360 /39=4240. Integer.\n\nAll good.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. So n + 2 could be any of the divisors, but what if n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but in reality, the division only works because of the constants canceled out? Wait, but we checked all the n's and they work, so seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a case where n + 2 divides 39, but in reality, n + 2 doesn't divide the product because of some miscalculation? But we tested all three n's, and they all work.\n\nAlternatively, could there be n's not in this list that still satisfy the divisibility? According to our analysis using the Remainder Theorem and gcd, no. So unless there's a mistake in that analysis.\n\nWait, let's suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's take n=4. n + 2=6. Then 6 divides 3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5. Not integer. So n=4 not a solution, which is correct.\n\nn=5: n + 2=7. 3*8*34=816. 816 /7\u2248116.57. Not integer.\n\nn=6: n + 2=8. 3*9*(36 +9)=3*9*45=1215. 1215 /8=151.875. Not integer.\n\nn=7: n + 2=9. 3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.333... Not integer.\n\nn=8: n + 2=10. 3*11*73=2379. 2379 /10=237.9. Not integer.\n\nn=9: n + 2=11. 3*12*(81 +9)=3*12*90=3240. 3240 /11\u2248294.545... Not integer.\n\nn=10: n + 2=12. 3*13*109=4251. 4251 /12\u2248354.25. Not integer.\n\nn=12: n + 2=14. 3*15*(144 +9)=3*15*153=6885. 6885 /14\u2248491.785... Not integer.\n\nn=13: n + 2=15. 3*16*178=8544. 8544 /15=569.6. Not integer.\n\nn=14: n + 2=16. 3*17*205=10455. 10455 /16\u2248653.4375. Not integer.\n\nn=15: n + 2=17. 3*18*(225 +9)=3*18*234=12636. 12636 /17=743.294... Not integer.\n\nContinuing up seems not useful. So all tested n's not in our list don't work, and the ones in the list do. So conclusion: answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Wait, n= -13 or something, but n must be positive. So no.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement: \"sum of all positive integers n\". So we need to make sure we have all such n. According to our analysis, only 1,11,37. But let me check n= 25. Wait n + 2=27. 27 divides 3*(28)*(625 +9)=3*28*634=3*28*634. Let's see:\n\nCompute 3*28=84. 84*634. Let's compute 80*634=50,720 and 4*634=2,536. Total=50,720 +2,536=53,256. Now divide by 27: 27*1972=53,244. 53,256 -53,244=12. Remainder 12. Not divisible.\n\nWait, n= 16: n + 2=18. 3*19*(256 +9)=3*19*265=15105. 15105 /18=839.166..., nope.\n\nWait, n= 17: n + 2=19. 3*20*(289 +9)=3*20*298=17,880. 17,880 /19=941.052..., nope.\n\nWait, n= 25: checked above.\n\nWait, n= 39: n + 2=41. 41 divides 3*(42)*(39\u00b2 +9). 39\u00b2=1521, +9=1530. So 3*42*1530=3*42*1530. 42*1530=64,260. 3*64,260=192,780. Divide by 41: 41*4700=192,700. 192,780 -192,700=80. 80/41\u22481.95. Remainder 80-41=39. Not divisible.\n\nWait, seems like no other n's work. So conclusion: answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, in our gcd analysis earlier, we saw that gcd(d, n\u00b2 + 9)=gcd(d,13). So if d divides 39, then d can be 3,13,39. But suppose d divides 3*13, but in the expression 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9), the factor of 3 is already present, so if d divides 3, then since 3 divides the product, but combined with the previous analysis... Wait, but our previous analysis already took into account the factor of 3.\n\nAlternatively, could n + 2 divide 3*(n\u00b2 + 9), and since gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9)=gcd(n + 2,13), then n + 2 divides 3*13. Which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as n + 2 divides 3*13, so n + 2 divides 39, which loops back.\n\nAlternatively, think of possible n + 2 values:\n\nCase 1: n + 2 divides 3. Then n + 2 \u2208 {1,3}. But n positive, so n + 2 \u22653, so n + 2=3, n=1.\n\nCase 2: n + 2 divides 13. Then n + 2=13, since 13 is prime. So n=11.\n\nCase 3: n + 2 divides 3*13 but not dividing 3 or 13. Then n + 2 divides 39 and gcd(n + 2,3)=3 and gcd(n + 2,13)=13. So n + 2=39.\n\nHence all cases covered. So n + 2=3,13,39.\n\nHence n=1,11,37. Sum=49.\n\nTherefore, I think this is solid. All methods converge to the same answer, tested all n's up to reasonable numbers and they don't work, only the three n's work, so I think the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and then sum all those n's. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says n is a positive integer, so n \u2265 1. We need n + 2 to divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2) should leave no remainder. So mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nWhich means that (n + 2) divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). To find such n, maybe I can use the concept of divisibility and modular arithmetic here. Since n + 2 divides the expression, then substituting n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2) should make the expression congruent to 0. Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Since n is positive, d must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies d \u2265 3). Now, substituting n = d - 2 into the expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((d - 2) + 3)((d - 2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nSo we need d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d | 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since d divides this product, and d and d + 1 are coprime (consecutive integers), then d must divide 3(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, more precisely, since gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, then d divides 3(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Hmm, but actually, more accurately, since d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), and gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, then d divides 3(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, because if a prime divides d, then it divides the product 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since it doesn't divide d + 1 (as gcd(d, d + 1) = 1), it must divide either 3 or (d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, all prime factors of d must divide 3 or (d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the remainder theorem. Since n + 2 divides the expression, then plugging n = -2 into the expression should give 0 modulo (n + 2). Wait, n is a variable here, but in terms of divisibility, if we think of polynomial division, then the remainder when dividing 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2) is equal to 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. Therefore, the remainder is 39, so in order for n + 2 to divide the expression, n + 2 must divide 39. Wait, that seems promising!\n\nWait, yes! By the Remainder Factor Theorem, if we have a polynomial P(n) and we divide by n - a, the remainder is P(a). In our case, we are dividing by n + 2 = n - (-2), so the remainder is P(-2). Therefore, the remainder when dividing 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2 is equal to 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) if and only if n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39. Since n is positive, n + 2 must be at least 3, so we can list all positive divisors of 39 greater than or equal to 3.\n\nWait, hold on, this seems like a much simpler approach. If the remainder is 39, then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be a divisor of 39. Therefore, n + 2 \u2208 {d | d divides 39, d \u2265 3}. Then n = d - 2. So first, let's factorize 39. 39 factors into 1 * 39, 3 * 13. So the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n + 2 \u2265 3, the possible divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore n could be 1, 11, 37. Wait, but wait, 3 - 2 = 1, 13 - 2 = 11, 39 - 2 = 37. But wait, 1 is positive, so n = 1, 11, 37. Then sum them up: 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. But wait, is that all?\n\nWait, but hold on. The Remainder Theorem approach says that n + 2 divides P(n) iff n + 2 divides P(-2). Therefore, n + 2 divides P(n) if and only if n + 2 divides 39, which is P(-2). Therefore, all divisors of 39, positive, so n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39. Since n is positive, n + 2 must be at least 3. So divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39, so n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39. Therefore n = 1, 11, 37. Then sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check n = 1. Let's compute (n + 2) = 3. Then 3 divides 3*(1 + 3)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, so yes, 3 divides 120. So n = 1 works.\n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. Then compute 3*(11 + 3)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130 = 3*14*130. Let's see, 13 divides this product obviously, so yes, 13 divides it. So n = 11 works.\n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. Then 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. 39 divides this product. Since 39 = 3*13, and 3 divides 3, 13 divides 40? No, 40 is 3*13 + 1, so 13 divides 1378? Let's check 1378 \u00f7 13: 13*100 = 1300, 1378 - 1300 = 78, 78 \u00f7 13 = 6. So yes, 13 divides 1378. Therefore, 13 divides the product, and 3 divides the product. So 39 divides the product. Therefore, n = 37 works.\n\nBut wait, but is that all? Wait, but divisors of 39 are also negative numbers, but since n + 2 must be positive, we don't consider negative divisors. So seems like n + 2 can only be 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check n = 4. Wait, n = 4, n + 2 = 6. Let's see if 6 divides 3*(4 + 3)*(16 + 9) = 3*7*25 = 525. 525 \u00f7 6 = 87.5, which is not integer. So 6 does not divide 525, so n = 4 is invalid. But according to our previous logic, n + 2 must divide 39, but 6 does not divide 39, so n = 4 is excluded, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let's check n = 2. n + 2 = 4. Then 3*(2 + 3)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 \u00f7 4 = 48.75, not integer. So n = 2 is invalid, which is not in our list. So seems okay.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. The Remainder Theorem says that n + 2 divides P(n) iff n + 2 divides P(-2). But in our case, P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then P(-2) = 3*(1)*(4 + 9) = 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides P(n) iff n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, all positive divisors of 39 greater or equal to 3. Which are 3, 13, 39. So n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Wait, in general, the Remainder Theorem approach here gives a necessary condition, but is it sufficient? Wait, if n + 2 divides 39, then n + 2 divides P(n), because P(n) = (n + 2)*Q(n) + 39, so if n + 2 divides 39, then n + 2 divides P(n). Conversely, if n + 2 divides P(n), then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, it's both necessary and sufficient. Therefore, our list is complete.\n\nWait, but wait, but 39's divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. But n + 2 could be equal to 1? But n must be positive, so n + 2 \u2265 3, so n + 2 = 1 would imply n = -1, which is invalid. Similarly n + 2 = 3 gives n = 1. So our list is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another check. Let's take n = 1. Then n + 2 = 3. Then 3 divides 3*(4)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 / 3 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 11: 13 divides 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. 13 divides 130, so yes.\n\nn = 37: 39 divides 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. 39 divides this because 3 divides 3 and 13 divides 1378 (as we saw earlier). So all three work.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Wait, but 39 has divisors 3, 13, 39. But what about divisors like, say, 3*3 = 9? Wait, 9 doesn't divide 39. 39 is 3*13, so all divisors are combinations of 3 and 13, so 1, 3, 13, 39. So no, 9 is not a divisor. Similarly, 26 = 2*13, but 2 doesn't divide 39, so 26 doesn't divide 39.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 must be one of 1, 3, 13, 39, but only 3, 13, 39 are valid. But what if n + 2 divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) as I thought earlier? Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem, the logic seems sound. Let me recap:\n\nGiven that n + 2 divides P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then the remainder when dividing P(n) by n + 2 is P(-2) = 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides P(n) if and only if n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be a divisor of 39, and since n + 2 \u2265 3, n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nBut wait, but wait another check. Let's take n = 5. Then n + 2 = 7. 7 divides 3*(5 + 3)*(25 + 9) = 3*8*34 = 816. 816 \u00f7 7 = 116.571..., which is not integer, so n = 5 is invalid. 7 does not divide 39, so according to our logic, it shouldn't work. Correct.\n\nWait, n = 3. n + 2 = 5. 3*(6)*(9 + 9) = 3*6*18 = 324. 324 \u00f7 5 = 64.8, not integer. 5 does not divide 39, so okay.\n\nWait, n = 7. n + 2 = 9. 3*(10)*(49 + 9) = 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 \u00f7 9 = 193.333... Not integer. 9 doesn't divide 39. Correct.\n\nWait, n = 13. n + 2 = 15. 3*(16)*(169 + 9) = 3*16*178 = 8544. 8544 \u00f7 15 = 569.6, not integer. 15 doesn't divide 39. Correct.\n\nWait, n = 12. n + 2 = 14. 3*(15)*(144 + 9) = 3*15*153 = 6885. 6885 \u00f7 14 = 491.785..., not integer. 14 doesn't divide 39. Correct.\n\nWait, seems like all the test cases are working with our logic. So n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me check n = 0. n must be positive, so n = 0 is invalid, but n + 2 = 2. 2 divides 3*(3)*(0 + 9) = 81. 81 \u00f7 2 = 40.5. Not integer. So okay.\n\nWait, but wait, here's a problem. Suppose n + 2 divides 39, but 39 = 3 * 13, so divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. But what if n + 2 divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) where d = n + 2. Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem, the logic is that n + 2 divides P(n) iff n + 2 divides P(-2). Therefore, regardless of the factors, n + 2 must divide 39. Therefore, the only solutions are n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check n = 4. Wait, n + 2 = 6. 6 divides 3*(6)*(16 + 9) = 3*6*25 = 450. 450 \u00f7 6 = 75. Wait, wait, hold on! Wait, n = 4. Wait, n + 2 = 6. Then according to my previous calculation, n = 4 should not be a solution because 6 does not divide 39, but according to this calculation, 3*(4 + 3)*(4\u00b2 + 9) = 3*7*25 = 525. 525 \u00f7 6 = 87.5, which is not integer. Wait, but in my mind, I thought I miscalculated. Wait, 3*(n + 3) = 3*(4 + 3) = 21. n\u00b2 + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25. Then 21*25 = 525. 525 divided by 6 is indeed 87.5. So n = 4 is invalid.\n\nWait, but wait, in my mind I thought I had a different calculation. Wait, okay, so n = 4 is invalid. So our previous logic holds.\n\nWait, but here's a catch. Let me check n = 5. Wait, n + 2 = 7. Then 3*(5 + 3)*(25 + 9) = 3*8*34 = 816. 816 \u00f7 7 = 116.571..., not integer. So okay.\n\nWait, n = 2. n + 2 = 4. 3*(5)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 \u00f7 4 = 48.75. Not integer.\n\nWait, n = 6. n + 2 = 8. 3*(9)*(36 + 9) = 3*9*45 = 1215. 1215 \u00f7 8 = 151.875. Not integer.\n\nWait, n = 7. n + 2 = 9. 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 \u00f7 9 = 193.333...\n\nWait, n = 8. n + 2 = 10. 3*11*(64 + 9) = 3*11*73 = 2409. 2409 \u00f7 10 = 240.9. Not integer.\n\nWait, n = 9. n + 2 = 11. 3*12*(81 + 9) = 3*12*90 = 3240. 3240 \u00f7 11 = 294.545... Not integer. Wait, but 11 divides 3240? Wait, 11*294 = 3234, 3240 - 3234 = 6. So no. So n = 9 is invalid.\n\nWait, n = 10. n + 2 = 12. 3*13*(100 + 9) = 3*13*109 = 4251. 4251 \u00f7 12 = 354.25. Not integer.\n\nn = 11. n + 2 = 13. 3*14*130 = 5460. 5460 \u00f7 13 = 420. So that works.\n\nWait, okay, so seems like only n = 1, 11, 37. Wait, but wait n = 13. n + 2 = 15. 3*15*(169 + 9) = 3*15*178 = 8010. 8010 \u00f7 15 = 534. So 15 divides 8010. Wait, but according to our previous logic, n + 2 = 15 should not divide P(n), since 15 does not divide 39. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, n = 13. Let's compute n + 2 = 15. Then 3*(13 + 3)*(13\u00b2 + 9) = 3*16*(169 + 9) = 3*16*178 = 3*2848 = 8544. Wait, wait, 16*178 = 2848? Wait, 16*170 = 2720, 16*8 = 128, so 2720 + 128 = 2848. Then 3*2848 = 8544. Then 8544 \u00f7 15 = 569.6. Which is not integer. Wait, so my previous calculation was wrong. Wait, confusion between n = 12 and n = 13.\n\nWait, n = 13: n + 2 = 15. 3*(13 + 3) = 3*16 = 48. n\u00b2 + 9 = 169 + 9 = 178. Then 48*178 = 8544. 8544 \u00f7 15 = 569.6. Not integer. So n = 13 does not work. So my mistake earlier.\n\nWait, n = 14: n + 2 = 16. 3*(17)*(196 + 9) = 3*17*205 = 10455. 10455 \u00f7 16 = 653.4375. Not integer.\n\nWait, n = 16: n + 2 = 18. 3*(19)*(256 + 9) = 3*19*265 = 15105. 15105 \u00f7 18 = 839.166..., not integer.\n\nWait, n = 5: n + 2 = 7. 3*8*34 = 816. 816 \u00f7 7 = 116.571...\n\nWait, so seems like only n = 1, 11, 37 work. Wait, but wait n = 12. n + 2 = 14. 3*(15)*(144 + 9) = 3*15*153 = 6885. 6885 \u00f7 14 = 491.785..., not integer.\n\nWait, n = 10: n + 2 = 12. 3*13*109 = 4251. 4251 \u00f7 12 = 354.25.\n\nWait, n = 17: n + 2 = 19. Let's check if 19 divides 3*(20)*(289 + 9) = 3*20*298 = 17880. 17880 \u00f7 19: 19*900 = 17100, 17880 - 17100 = 780. 19*40 = 760, 780 - 760 = 20. So remainder 20 - 19 = 1. Not divisible.\n\nWait, n = 18: n + 2 = 20. 3*21*(324 + 9) = 3*21*333 = 20979. 20979 \u00f7 20 = 1048.95. Not integer.\n\nWait, n = 25: n + 2 = 27. 3*(28)*(625 + 9) = 3*28*634 = 53256. 53256 \u00f7 27: 27*1900 = 51300, 53256 - 51300 = 1956. 27*72 = 1944, 1956 - 1944 = 12. Not divisible.\n\nWait, n = 3: n + 2 = 5. 3*6*18 = 324. 324 \u00f7 5 = 64.8. Not integer.\n\nWait, so all test cases not in our list don't work. So seems like our initial logic is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another check. Let's take n = 1. Then n + 2 = 3. 3 divides 3*(4)*(1 + 9) = 120. 120 \u00f7 3 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 11: 13 divides 3*14*130. 14*130 = 1820. 1820*3 = 5460. 5460 \u00f7 13 = 420. Correct.\n\nn = 37: 39 divides 3*40*1378. 40*1378 = 55120. 55120*3 = 165360. 165360 \u00f7 39: Let's divide 165360 by 39. 39*4000 = 156000. 165360 - 156000 = 9360. 39*240 = 9360. So total is 4000 + 240 = 4240. So yes, divisible. Correct.\n\nWait, so all three work. So sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\". So the product is 3 multiplied by (n + 3) multiplied by (n\u00b2 + 9). So that's correct.\n\nBut here's a thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But n + 2 and n + 3 are coprime? Let's see. gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = gcd(n + 2, 1) = 1. So n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Because since gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, then n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Hmm, so that's another way to look at it.\n\nTherefore, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's see. Then n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute n\u00b2 + 9 in terms of n + 2. Let's write n\u00b2 + 9 = n\u00b2 - 4 + 13 = (n - 2)(n + 2) + 13. Therefore, n\u00b2 + 9 = (n + 2)(n - 2) + 13. Therefore, 3(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3(n + 2)(n - 2) + 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) if and only if n + 2 divides 39. Which is the same conclusion as before. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39, so n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39 greater or equal to 3, so n + 2 = 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we get the same answer. So seems like 49 is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Let me check n = 1 again. n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So n = 1: 3 divides 3*4*10 = 120. 120 / 3 = 40. Correct.\n\nWait, but here's a catch. Let's suppose n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 could be any divisor, positive or negative, but n must be positive. But 39 is positive, so all its divisors are positive here. So okay.\n\nWait, but wait, but in the previous calculation, we have n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), and we showed that n + 2 divides 39. But in another way, if we use the fact that n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), then:\n\nLet d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Then n\u00b2 + 9 = (d - 2)^2 + 9 = d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9 = d\u00b2 - 4d + 13. Then 3(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39. Then d divides this expression. Therefore, d divides (3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39). Since d divides 3d\u00b2 - 12d, then d divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion. So d divides 39, so d \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39}, leading to n = -1, 1, 11, 37. But n positive, so n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, same answer. So seems like 49 is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Let me check n = 1 again. If n = 1, then n + 2 = 3. Then 3 divides 3*(1 + 3)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 / 3 = 40. Correct.\n\nWait, n = 11: n + 2 = 13. Then 13 divides 3*(14)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. 14*130 = 1820. 1820*3 = 5460. 5460 / 13 = 420. Correct.\n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. Then 39 divides 3*(40)*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. 40*1378 = 55120. 55120*3 = 165360. 165360 / 39 = 4240. Correct.\n\nSo all three work. So sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\". So the product is 3 multiplied by (n + 3) multiplied by (n\u00b2 + 9). So that's exactly what we considered.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the product of 3, n + 3, and n\u00b2 + 9\", which is the same thing.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a misinterpretation, but I think we are okay.\n\nWait, but here's another thought. Suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Since n + 2 divides P(n), then gcd(n + 2, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)) = n + 2. But since gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Let d = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Then d divides n + 2 and n\u00b2 + 9. Then d divides n\u00b2 + 9 - n*(n + 2) = n\u00b2 + 9 - n\u00b2 - 2n = -2n + 9. Then d divides n + 2 and -2n + 9. Then d divides 2*(n + 2) + (-2n + 9) = 2n + 4 - 2n + 9 = 13. Therefore, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) divides 13. Therefore, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) is either 1 or 13.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(n + 2, 3). Since n + 2 divides 39, which is 3*13, so n + 2 can have factors 3 and/or 13.\n\nTherefore, combining all together:\n\nSince n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, then n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). And since gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) is either 1 or 13, then n + 2 divides 3*1 or 3*13. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nWe have n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Let d = n + 2. Then d divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). We also found that gcd(d, n\u00b2 + 9) divides 13. Since d divides 39, which is 3*13, so d can be 1, 3, 13, 39. So possible d's. Which is consistent with our previous result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we get that n + 2 must be a divisor of 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, but here's a catch. Suppose d divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), and gcd(d, n\u00b2 + 9) divides 13, then d divides 3*13 = 39. Which again leads to same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, all approaches lead us to n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Let me check n = 1 again. gcd(3, 1\u00b2 + 9) = gcd(3, 10) = 1. So gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1 here.\n\nFor n = 11: gcd(13, 121 + 9) = gcd(13, 130) = 13.\n\nFor n = 37: gcd(39, 1369 + 9) = gcd(39, 1378). Let's compute gcd(39, 1378). 1378 \u00f7 39 = 35.333... 39*35 = 1365. 1378 - 1365 = 13. Then gcd(39, 13) = 13. So gcd is 13.\n\nTherefore, in n = 1: gcd(3, 10) = 1, so n + 2 divides 3*1 = 3.\n\nIn n = 11: gcd(13, 130) = 13, so n + 2 divides 3*13 = 39, but n + 2 = 13 divides 3*13.\n\nIn n = 37: gcd(39, 1378) = 13, so n + 2 divides 3*13 = 39. But n + 2 = 39 divides 3*13 = 39. Which works.\n\nBut regardless, all this seems to confirm that n + 2 divides 39.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: n = 1, 11, 37. Sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Wait, let me check n = 13. Wait, n + 2 = 15. Which divides 39? No. Wait, but gcd(15, n\u00b2 + 9) = gcd(15, 169 + 9) = gcd(15, 178). 178 \u00f7 15 = 11*15 = 165, 178 - 165 = 13. gcd(15, 13) = 1. Then gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. Then n + 2 divides 3*1 = 3. But 15 does not divide 3, so n = 13 is invalid, which is consistent.\n\nWait, so all in all, after multiple approaches and checks, I think the answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\". Is that product equal to 3 multiplied by (n + 3) multiplied by (n squared plus 9)? Yes. So that's what we considered.\n\nAlternatively, if it was 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9), yes. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a misinterpretation of the problem statement, but given the way it's written, I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the product of 3, n, +3, n^2, and 9\", which would be different, but that's not the case.\n\nSo, given all that, I think the answer is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Wait, let me check n = 1 again. If n = 1: n + 2 = 3 divides 3*(4)*(10) = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40. Correct.\n\nWait, n = 11: 13 divides 3*14*130. 13 divides 130, so yes.\n\nn = 37: 39 divides 3*40*1378. 39 divides 3*40*1378. Since 39 = 13*3. 3 divides 3, and 13 divides 1378 (as we saw earlier). So yes.\n\nBut wait, but wait. Wait, let's think differently. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 can be any divisor, positive, of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n positive, n + 2 \u2265 3. So n = 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't use the Remainder Theorem, but instead tried to do it step by step.\n\nWe have n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let\u2019s denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Substitute into the expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3(d + 1)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nWe need d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, then d divides 3(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let\u2019s write this as:\n\nd | 3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39\n\nBut since d divides 3d\u00b2 - 12d, it must divide 39. Therefore, d divides 39. So same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, we get that d divides 39, so n + 2 divides 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nTherefore, I think confidently that the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and then sum all those n's. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. So mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nWhich means that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). To solve this, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. If I consider everything modulo n + 2, then n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). That substitution might simplify things.\n\nLet me try substituting n \u2261 -2 into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute each part:\n\nFirst, n + 3 \u2261 (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2)\n\nNext, n\u00b2 + 9. Since n \u2261 -2, n\u00b2 = (-2)\u00b2 = 4. So n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2)\n\nSo putting that all together, the entire expression becomes:\n\n3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod (n + 2)\n\nTherefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Which means that n + 2 divides 39. So n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39. Since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1). So the positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But n + 2 \u2265 3, so possible divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, or 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that all? Let me check. Because sometimes when you substitute like that, you might miss some divisors if there are common factors or something. Wait, but according to the logic above, since we have 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 39 mod (n + 2), then n + 2 divides 39. So n + 2 must divide 39, which has divisors 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n + 2 must be at least 3, n can be 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut let me test these n's to see if they actually work. Let's check n = 1:\n\nCheck n = 1: n + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Does 3 divide 120? Yes, 120 / 3 = 40. So that works.\n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. The product is 3*(11 + 3)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let's compute 3*14 = 42, 42*130 = 5460. Then 5460 divided by 13. Let's do 13*420 = 5460. So yes, exactly divisible. So that works.\n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. The product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute 3*40 = 120. 37\u00b2 is 1369, so 1369 + 9 = 1378. Then 120*1378. Let's compute that: 100*1378 = 137800, 20*1378 = 27560, so total is 137800 + 27560 = 165,360. Divide by 39: 39*4000 = 156,000. 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360. 39*240 = 9,360. So total is 4000 + 240 = 4240. So yes, divisible. So n = 37 works.\n\nSo according to this, the possible n's are 1, 11, 37, sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Wait, but is that all? The problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\". But wait, is there a possibility of more divisors?\n\nWait, but according to our reasoning, since n + 2 divides 39, and 39 has only divisors 1, 3, 13, 39. But let me check if there's a mistake here. Because sometimes in these problems, even if n + 2 divides 39, there could be cases where even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39, but divides the product because n + 2 could share factors with the terms in the product. Wait, but in our calculation above, we used modular arithmetic to substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), and found that the expression reduces to 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, regardless of other factors, n + 2 must divide 39. Therefore, only the divisors of 39 greater than or equal to 3. So only 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check n = 2. Wait n = 2 would give n + 2 = 4. Let's see if 4 divides 3*(2 + 3)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75. Not an integer. So n = 2 is invalid.\n\nn = 3: n + 2 = 5. The product is 3*(6)*(9 + 9) = 3*6*18 = 324. 324 / 5 = 64.8. Not integer.\n\nWait, but according to our previous logic, n + 2 must divide 39. So n + 2 can only be 3,13,39, so n can only be 1,11,37. But maybe we need to check if n + 2 divides 39, but considering that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) could have factors in common with n + 2. Wait, but according to the logic, since we have:\n\nLet me recall that in general, if we have an expression like f(n) \u2261 0 mod d, then d divides f(n). Here, d = n + 2, and f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So substituting n = -2 into f(n) gives 3*(1)*(13) = 39, so f(n) \u2261 39 mod d. Therefore, d divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39, so yes, only divisors of 39. So our reasoning should hold. So only n + 2 = 3,13,39. Therefore, n =1,11,37.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 4. n + 2 =6. 3*(7)*(16 +9) = 3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5. Not integer.\n\nn = 5: n + 2 =7. 3*(8)*(25 +9)= 3*8*34=816. 816 /7 \u2248 116.57. Not integer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's check n = 0. Wait, n must be positive integer, so n =0 is invalid.\n\nWait, n = 37 is okay. Hmm. So according to all this, only three numbers. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me check n + 2 divides 39. So divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39. So n +2 must be one of these. But n positive integer. So n +2 \u2265 3. So n +2 can be 3,13,39. So n =1,11,37.\n\nBut wait, hold on. What if n + 2 divides 39, but in the original problem, n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Suppose n +2 divides 39, then n +2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But is the converse true? Suppose n +2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), does it follow that n +2 divides 39? Because we used modular arithmetic substitution, so n +2 divides 39. So our reasoning gives that n +2 must divide 39, so the set of solutions is exactly the n where n +2 divides 39. Therefore, only three solutions.\n\nWait, but in similar problems sometimes you can have n +2 divides 39 times some factor. Wait, but in our case, we used the fact that f(n) = 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u2261 39 mod (n +2), so f(n) \u2261 0 mod (n +2) implies 39 \u22610 mod (n +2). Therefore, n +2 divides 39. So yes, it's an \"if and only if\" situation.\n\nTherefore, only divisors of 39 greater or equal to 3. So n +2 =3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but let me check n=1 again. If n=1, then n +2=3 divides 3*(1+3)*(1+9)=3*4*10. So 3 divides 120? Yes. 120 divided by 3 is 40. Correct.\n\nn=11: 13 divides 3*14*130. 3*14=42, 42*130=5460. 5460 divided by 13 is 420. Correct.\n\nn=37: 39 divides 3*40*1378. 3*40=120, 120*1378=165360. Divided by 39: 165360 /39. Let's compute 39*4000=156000. 165360-156000=9360. 9360/39=240. So total 4240. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all three n's work. So sum is 1+11+37=49. Hmm. But wait, wait a second. Wait, but 39's divisors are also negative numbers. But n +2 must be positive, and n positive, so we don't have to consider negative divisors. So seems okay.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Suppose n +2 divides 39. So n +2 can be any positive divisor of 39. But 39 factors as 3*13, so divisors are 1,3,13,39. Since n is positive, n +2 must be at least 3, so n +2=3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. So this seems right.\n\nBut wait, wait another check. Let's take n=1, n+2=3. Then 3 divides 3*(4)*(10). So obviously yes. Similarly n +2=13 divides 3*(14)*(130). Since 13 divides 130, so yes. Similarly n +2=39 divides 3*40*1378. 1378 divided by 39. Wait, 39*35=1365, 1378-1365=13, so no. Wait, 1378=39*35 +13. Hmm, so 1378 isn't divisible by 39. Wait, but the entire product is 3*40*1378. So 3 and 39 share a factor of 3. So 3*40*1378 divided by 39 is equal to (3/39)*40*1378 = (1/13)*40*1378. Then 1378 divided by 13: 13*100=1300, 1378-1300=78, which is 13*6. So 1378=13*106. Therefore, (1/13)*40*13*106=40*106=4240. Which is integer. So even though n\u00b2 +9 may not be divisible by n +2, the product with 3(n +3) may be divisible. So even if individual terms may not be divisible, the product is. Therefore, the logic of substituting n \u2261 -2 mod (n +2) and getting the expression \u226139 mod (n +2) is still valid. Therefore, n +2 divides 39.\n\nBut wait, here's another thought. Let's suppose that n +2 divides 39, but in the problem statement, the divisor is n +2, so n +2 divides 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9). But if n +2 divides 39, then n +2 divides 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9). But perhaps there are n where n +2 divides the product even if n +2 doesn't divide 39? Wait, according to the modular arithmetic substitution, no. Because we have that:\n\nIf n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9), then 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u22610 mod (n +2). But since n \u2261 -2 mod (n +2), substituting gives us that expression \u22613*(1)*(4 +9)=3*1*13=39 mod (n +2). Therefore, 39 \u22610 mod (n +2), so n +2 divides 39. Therefore, the converse is true. Therefore, only divisors of 39.\n\nTherefore, our original conclusion is correct. So only three values. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check n=4. Wait, n=4: n+2=6. 3*(7)*(16 +9)=3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5. Not integer. So n=4 doesn't work, which is consistent.\n\nn=5: n +2=7. 3*8*34=816. 816/7\u2248116.57. Not integer.\n\nn=6: n +2=8. 3*9*45=1215. 1215 /8=151.875. Not integer.\n\nn=7: n +2=9. 3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.333... Not integer.\n\nn=8: n +2=10. 3*11*73=2409. 2409 /10=240.9. Not integer.\n\nn=9: n +2=11. 3*12*90=3240. 3240 /11\u2248294.545... Not integer.\n\nn=10: n +2=12. 3*13*109=4251. 4251 /12=354.25. Not integer.\n\nn=11: works. n=12: n +2=14. 3*15*153=6885. 6885 /14\u2248491.785... Not integer.\n\nn=13: n +2=15. 3*16*178=8544. 8544 /15=569.6. Not integer.\n\nn=14: n +2=16. 3*17*207=10557. 10557 /16=659.8125. Not integer.\n\nn=15: n +2=17. 3*18*234=12636. 12636 /17. Let's see: 17*700=11900, 12636-11900=736. 17*43=731, so 700+43=743, remainder 5. Not divisible.\n\nn=16: n +2=18. 3*19*265=15105. 15105 /18=839.166... Not integer.\n\nn=17: n +2=19. 3*20*306=18360. 18360 /19. 19*900=17100. 18360-17100=1260. 19*66=1254, so 900+66=966, remainder 6. Not divisible.\n\nn=18: n +2=20. 3*21*333=20979. 20979 /20=1048.95. Not integer.\n\nn=19: n +2=21. 3*22*370=24420. 24420 /21=1162.857... Not integer.\n\nn=20: n +2=22. 3*23*409=28221. 28221 /22\u22481282.77. Not integer.\n\nContinuing up seems tedious, but maybe n=37 is the last one. Wait, but according to our previous logic, n=37 is the only larger n. So unless there's a mistake in the logic, the answer should be 49.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Suppose n +2 divides 39. So n +2 could be 3,13,39. But 39 is 3*13. Suppose that n +2 divides 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9). So even if n +2 shares a common factor with n +3 or n\u00b2 +9. Wait, but n +3 = (n +2) +1, so n +2 and n +3 are coprime. Because consecutive integers. Similarly, n\u00b2 +9. Let's compute gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9). Let d divides n +2 and n\u00b2 +9. Then d divides n\u00b2 +9 -n*(n +2 - 2). Wait, n\u00b2 +9 -n*(n +2 -2). Wait, n +2 is the divisor, so n \u2261 -2 mod d. Therefore, n\u00b2 +9 \u2261 (-2)^2 +9=4 +9=13 mod d. So if d divides n\u00b2 +9, then d divides 13. Therefore, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9) divides 13.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(n +2, n +3)=1 as we saw.\n\nTherefore, n +2 divides 3*1*13=39. Which is why our previous reasoning holds. Because n +2 divides 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9), and since gcd(n +2, n +3)=1, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9) divides 13, so n +2 divides 3*13=39. Therefore, n +2 divides 39, which is exactly our result. Therefore, this confirms that n +2 must be a divisor of 39, so our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9) divides 13. So if n +2 has a factor of 13, then n\u00b2 +9 \u22610 mod 13. But in our previous logic, we have that n +2 divides 39, so possible n +2=3,13,39. So if n +2=13, gcd(13, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(13, (-2)^2 +9)=gcd(13,13)=13. Similarly, n +2=3: gcd(3, n\u00b2 +9). n=-2 mod 3, so n\u00b2 +9 \u2261 (4 mod 3) +0 mod3=1 mod3. So gcd(3, n\u00b2 +9)=1. Similarly, n +2=39. Then gcd(39, n\u00b2 +9). Since n=-2 mod 39, so n\u00b2 +9=4 +9=13 mod 13. Wait, 39 is 3*13. So gcd(39,13)=13. So gcd(39, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(39,13)=13. So n +2=39 divides 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9). Since gcd(39, n +3)=gcd(39,1)=1, gcd(39, n\u00b2 +9)=13. So 39 divides 3*(...), which is 3*(...*13). So 3*13=39, so yes, 39 divides 3*13*k. So yes.\n\nTherefore, even considering gcds, everything checks out. So n +2 divides 39, and all divisors are considered.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: n=1,11,37. Sum is 49. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Wait, the problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\". So unless there are more solutions. Wait, but according to our analysis, only n=1,11,37. Wait, but let me check n=4 again. Wait n=4: n +2=6. Then 6 divides 3*(7)*(25). 3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5. Not integer. So no. How about n=5: n +2=7. 3*8*(25 +9)=3*8*34=816. 816 divided by 7\u2248116.57. Not integer.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. If n +2 divides 39, then n +2 must be 3,13,39. But 39's divisors are also composite numbers. Wait, but we already considered all divisors. So unless there's a mistake in the modulus calculations.\n\nWait, let's rederive the condition again. We have n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let me write this as:\n\nThere exists integer k such that 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) = k(n +2)\n\nWe need to find positive integers n and k such that this equation holds.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nk = [3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)] / (n +2)\n\nWe need k to be integer.\n\nWe can perform polynomial division of 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) by n +2.\n\nFirst, expand the numerator:\n\nFirst compute (n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) = n(n\u00b2 +9) + 3(n\u00b2 +9) = n\u00b3 +9n +3n\u00b2 +27 = n\u00b3 +3n\u00b2 +9n +27.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3n\u00b3 +9n\u00b2 +27n +81.\n\nNow divide 3n\u00b3 +9n\u00b2 +27n +81 by n +2.\n\nLet's perform polynomial long division:\n\nDivide 3n\u00b3 +9n\u00b2 +27n +81 by n +2.\n\nFirst term: 3n\u00b3 /n = 3n\u00b2. Multiply divisor by 3n\u00b2: 3n\u00b3 +6n\u00b2.\n\nSubtract: (3n\u00b3 +9n\u00b2 +27n +81) - (3n\u00b3 +6n\u00b2) = 3n\u00b2 +27n +81.\n\nNext term: 3n\u00b2 /n = 3n. Multiply divisor by 3n: 3n\u00b2 +6n.\n\nSubtract: (3n\u00b2 +27n +81) - (3n\u00b2 +6n) = 21n +81.\n\nNext term: 21n /n =21. Multiply divisor by 21: 21n +42.\n\nSubtract: (21n +81) - (21n +42) = 39.\n\nSo the division yields 3n\u00b2 +3n +21 with a remainder of 39. Therefore:\n\n3n\u00b3 +9n\u00b2 +27n +81 = (n +2)(3n\u00b2 +3n +21) + 39\n\nTherefore, k = [ (n +2)(3n\u00b2 +3n +21) + 39 ] / (n +2) = 3n\u00b2 +3n +21 + 39/(n +2)\n\nTherefore, for k to be integer, 39/(n +2) must be integer. Therefore, n +2 divides 39. Which is exactly what we had before. So this confirms again that n +2 must divide 39, so n +2 \u2208 {1,3,13,39}, and since n positive, n +2 \u22653. So n \u2208 {1,11,37}. Therefore, the answer is indeed 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and then sum all those n's. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is asking for n where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2) should result in an integer. So, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nWhich means that when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2), the remainder is zero. Alternatively, n + 2 must be a divisor of 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Since n is a positive integer, n + 2 is at least 3 (since n \u2265 1). \n\nTo approach this, maybe I can use the concept of modular arithmetic here. If n + 2 divides that expression, then substituting n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2) into the expression should make the expression congruent to zero modulo (n + 2). Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Since n is positive, d must be at least 3. Our goal is to find all d \u2265 3 such that d divides 3(d - 2 + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ). Let's simplify that expression in terms of d.\n\nFirst, substitute n = d - 2 into the product:\n\n3(d - 2 + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nTherefore, we need d to divide 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). So, d | 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since d divides this product, all prime factors of d must divide 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). However, d and d + 1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Similarly, d and d\u00b2 - 4d + 13 might share some common factors. Let's analyze the gcds here.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s compute gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, since consecutive numbers are coprime.\n\ngcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13): Let's compute this. Let\u2019s call this gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = gcd(d, -4d + 13) = gcd(d, (-4d + 13) + 4*d) = gcd(d, 13). Therefore, gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) is either 1 or 13, depending on whether d is a multiple of 13.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(d, 3) can be either 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, since d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), and since gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, we can say that d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Because d must divide the product 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), and since d and d + 1 are coprime, d must divide 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, actually, more precisely: Since d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), and gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, then d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). That seems correct. Because if a prime divides d, it can't divide d + 1, so it must divide 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore:\n\nd | 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nTherefore, there exists an integer k such that 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = k*d. Which implies that k = 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)/d = 3d - 12 + 39/d. Since k must be an integer, 39/d must be an integer. Therefore, d divides 39. Wait, this seems a key point.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 0 mod d. Let's compute this congruence:\n\n3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 3*(0 - 0 + 13) mod d, because d \u2261 0 mod d, so d\u00b2 \u2261 0, and -4d \u2261 0.\n\nTherefore, 3*13 \u2261 0 mod d => 39 \u2261 0 mod d. Therefore, d divides 39.\n\nAh! That's a much better way. So, since 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 39 mod d, so d divides 39. Therefore, d must be a positive divisor of 39. Since d \u2265 3, and the positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. Therefore, possible d's are 3, 13, 39. Wait, but wait, hold on. Wait, but 39 is 3*13, so divisors are 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut n is a positive integer, so n = d - 2 \u2265 1 => d \u2265 3. So possible d: 3,13,39. Wait, but wait, but hold on. Wait, perhaps negative divisors? No, since d = n + 2 and n positive, so d is positive integers \u2265 3.\n\nWait, but wait, but in the step above, we said that d divides 39. But 39's positive divisors are 1,3,13,39, so indeed d \u2208 {3,13,39}. Hmm. Therefore, n = d - 2, so n could be 1,11,37. Wait, so n is 1, 11, 37? Let me check this.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm this logic. So we started by saying that since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then substituting d = n + 2, we get that d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Then we considered the congruence mod d, and found that 39 \u2261 0 mod d, hence d divides 39. Therefore, possible d's are divisors of 39, which are 1,3,13,39, but since d \u2265 3, possible d's are 3,13,39. Then n = d - 2: 1,11,37.\n\nWait, but before accepting this, we need to verify that each of these d's actually work, because sometimes when you use modular arithmetic, you can get necessary conditions but not necessarily sufficient. So we need to check each n=1,11,37 to see if n + 2 divides the product.\n\nLet me check n=1:\n\nCheck if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So yes, n=1 works.\n\nn=11: n + 2 =13. Check if 13 divides 3*(11 +3)*(121 +9)= 3*14*130. Let's compute that: 3*14=42, 42*130=5460. 5460 divided by 13: 13*420=5460. So yes, divisible. So n=11 works.\n\nn=37: n + 2=39. Check if 39 divides 3*(37 +3)*(37\u00b2 +9). Let's compute:\n\nFirst compute 37 +3=40. 37\u00b2=1369, so 1369 +9=1378.\n\nSo product is 3*40*1378. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst 3*40=120. 120*1378: Let's compute 100*1378=137800, 20*1378=27560, so total 137800 + 27560 = 165,360.\n\nNow divide by 39. Let's see:\n\nFirst, factor 39=3*13.\n\nCheck if 165,360 divisible by 3: 1+6+5+3+6+0=21, yes. 165360 / 3=55120.\n\nCheck if 55120 divisible by 13: Let's divide 55120 by 13.\n\n13*4000=52000. 55120 - 52000=3120.\n\n13*240=3120. So total is 4000 + 240=4240. So yes, divisible. So n=37 works.\n\nSo n=1,11,37 are solutions? Wait, but wait, hold on. Wait, but according to our logic above, the only possible d's are 3,13,39. So only three solutions? But maybe we need to check if there are more divisors. Wait, but according to the congruence, d divides 39. Therefore, only those divisors. Hmm. Wait, but let's check with n=2. Wait, n=2 would correspond to d=4. 4 divides 3*(5)*(4 +9)=3*5*13=195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75, not integer, so n=2 is not a solution, which is good. Similarly, n=3: d=5. Check if 5 divides 3*6*(9 +9)=3*6*18=324. 324 /5=64.8, not integer. So n=3 is not a solution.\n\nWait, so according to this logic, only n=1,11,37 are solutions. But wait, wait a second. Wait, but let's check n=4: d=6. Check if 6 divides 3*7*(16 +9)=3*7*25=525. 525 /6=87.5, nope. n=5: d=7. 3*8*(25+9)=3*8*34=816. 816 /7\u2248116.57, not integer. n=6: d=8. 3*9*(36 +9)=3*9*45=1215. 1215 /8=151.875. Not integer.\n\nWait, so seems like only n=1,11,37. Hmm. But wait, wait a minute. Wait, but in the step where we concluded that d divides 39, we used that d divides 39. But wait, let me check that again.\n\nWe had that since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then substituting d = n + 2, we get that d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Then we considered this divisibility condition. Then we used modular arithmetic to find that 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13) \u2261 39 mod d. Therefore, d divides 39. Wait, so is that correct?\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nWe have that d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d +13). Then, since gcd(d, d +1) =1, then d divides 3(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Wait, but how exactly? Wait, more precise: If a divides bc and gcd(a,b)=1, then a divides c. So in our case, since gcd(d, d +1)=1, then since d divides 3(d +1)(d\u00b2 -4d +13), then d divides 3(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Therefore, yes, so d divides 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Then 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13) = kd for some integer k. Then 3d\u00b2 -12d + 39 = kd. Then 3d\u00b2 - (k +12)d + 39 =0. Hmm, but this might not be the best approach.\n\nBut in the congruence, we can say that since d divides 3(d\u00b2 -4d +13), then 3(d\u00b2 -4d +13) \u22610 mod d. Then 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13) \u2261 3*(0 -0 +13)=39 mod d. Therefore, 39 \u22610 mod d, so d divides 39. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, d divides 39, so d \u2208 {1,3,13,39}. Since d \u22653, then only 3,13,39. So only n=1,11,37. Hmm. But wait, wait, but let me check n=4 again. Wait, n=4, d=6. According to our logic, 6 does not divide 39, so n=4 should not be a solution, which is correct. So seems okay.\n\nWait, but wait, here's a problem. Let me check n=5: d=7. 7 divides 39? No. So n=5 not a solution, which is correct. Wait, but wait, what about n=0? n must be positive, so n=0 not considered.\n\nBut wait, here's a thought. Suppose d divides 39, so possible divisors are 1,3,13,39, but could negative divisors? No, since n positive. So okay.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let's take d=3. Then n=1. Check. Okay. What about d divides 39, but 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39. So that's four divisors, but n positive, so three n's.\n\nWait, but wait another angle. Suppose that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's think in terms of division. If we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 +9) by n + 2, we can perform polynomial division or use substitution.\n\nLet me try substituting n = -2 into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 +9). By the factor theorem, if n + 2 divides the expression, then substituting n = -2 gives zero. Let's compute:\n\n3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 +9) = 3*(1)*(4 +9)=3*1*13=39. So the remainder when dividing by n + 2 is 39. Therefore, in order for n + 2 to divide the expression, it must divide the remainder 39. Which is exactly the same conclusion as before. So n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39 greater or equal to 3 (since n \u22651 => n +2 \u22653). So divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39. So n +2 \u2208 {3,13,39}, so n \u2208 {1,11,37}, same as before. Therefore, sum is 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nWait, so according to this reasoning, the answer is 49. But wait, but the problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", so if there are only three numbers, sum is 49. But I feel like there might be more solutions. Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem approach, the remainder is 39, so n +2 must divide 39. Therefore, only those three divisors. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, in polynomial division, if we divide f(n) by n + 2, the remainder is f(-2). Here f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 +9). So yes, remainder is 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides f(n) if and only if n + 2 divides 39. So this is a theorem. Therefore, the solutions are exactly the divisors of 39 greater than 2 (since n positive). So n +2 divides 39, so n +2 \u2208 {3,13,39}, so n \u2208 {1,11,37}, sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the product 3(n+3)(n\u00b2 +9)\". So, in other words, n + 2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Then according to the remainder theorem, since the remainder is 39, so yes, n +2 divides 39. Therefore, the logic is sound.\n\nWait, but let me check n=1: n +2=3 divides 3*(4)*(1 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120/3=40. Yes. n=11: 13 divides 3*14*(121 +9)=3*14*130. 3*14=42. 42*130=5460. 5460 /13=420. Correct. n=37: 39 divides 3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378. 3*40=120. 120*1378. Let's see, 120/39= (120 \u00f7 13)/3 \u2248 9.23/3. Wait, but we already checked this earlier, and it divided exactly. So 39 divides 120*1378.\n\nBut wait, according to the Remainder Theorem logic, n +2 divides 39. Therefore, only n +2=3,13,39. But let me test n=4 again. Wait, n=4: n +2=6. Does 6 divide 3*(7)*(16 +9)=3*7*25=525. 525 /6=87.5. Not integer. Correct. So n=4 is excluded.\n\nBut here's a catch. Wait, but in the Remainder Theorem approach, the remainder is 39. So in order for n +2 to divide f(n), it must divide the remainder 39. However, n +2 must divide 39. But n +2 divides 39, so n +2 must be a divisor of 39, but in integers. So all divisors of 39 are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b113, \u00b139. Since n is positive, n +2 must be at least 3, so positive divisors: 3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37. So sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, but in the problem statement, the expression to divide is 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9). But if n +2 divides this, but n +2 could also divide the 3 or (n +3) or (n\u00b2 +9). But in our analysis, we used the Remainder Theorem and found that the remainder is 39, so n +2 divides 39. Therefore, regardless of the factors, only divisors of 39 would work. So seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there might be a mistake here. For example, suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). But n +2 could divide into these terms in some combination. For example, even if n +2 doesn't divide 39, but factors of n +2 could divide different parts of 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). However, the Remainder Theorem approach seems to bypass that. Wait, but according to the theorem, if you want n - a divides f(n), then f(a)=0. But here, we have n +2 divides f(n), so the remainder is f(-2). Which is 39. Therefore, n +2 divides f(n) iff n +2 divides 39. Therefore, regardless of the factors, n +2 must divide 39. Therefore, only those three n's. Therefore, answer is 49.\n\nBut I need to be 100% sure here. Let me check n=1,11,37. All work. So maybe answer is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, here's a possible mistake. The Remainder Theorem tells us that n + 2 divides f(n) iff n +2 divides f(-2). Since f(-2)=39, so n +2 divides 39. So n +2 must be a divisor of 39. Since n +2 positive integer \u22653, so 3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. Therefore, sum 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut in that case, answer is 49. But wait, but let me check n=5. n=5, n +2=7. Check if 7 divides 3*(8)*(25 +9)=3*8*34=816. 816 /7: 7*116=812, so 816-812=4, so remainder 4. Not divisible. So n=5 not a solution.\n\nWait, n=7. n +2=9. Check 3*(10)*(49 +9)=3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.333... Not integer. So n=7 not a solution.\n\nWait, n=2: n +2=4. Check 3*5*13=195. 195 /4=48.75. Not integer.\n\nWait, n=9: n +2=11. Check 3*12*(81 +9)=3*12*90=3240. 3240 /11\u2248294.545... Not integer.\n\nWait, so seems like only n=1,11,37. But wait, wait, wait, let's check n=10. n +2=12. 3*13*(100 +9)=3*13*109=3*1417=4251. 4251 /12=354.25. Not integer.\n\nWait, n=12: n +2=14. 3*15*(144 +9)=3*15*153=6885. 6885 /14\u2248491.785..., nope.\n\nWait, n=13: n +2=15. 3*16*(169 +9)=3*16*178=8544. 8544 /15=569.6, nope.\n\nWait, n=14: n +2=16. 3*17*(196 +9)=3*17*205=10455. 10455 /16=653.4375, not integer.\n\nWait, seems like only n=1,11,37. Hmm. Wait, but wait another check. Let's take d=3,13,39.\n\nWait, but wait, but 39 has divisors such as 3*13, but we already considered all divisors. Wait, unless... Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem, n +2 divides 39. So even if n +2 is composite, as long as it divides 39. But 39 factors into 3*13. Therefore, divisors are 1,3,13,39. So even if n +2=3,13,39.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n +2 divides 39, but 39 could be positive or negative. But since n +2 positive, we only consider positive. Therefore, only those four divisors. So seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Then n +2 divides 39. Therefore, n +2 must divide 39. Therefore, n +2 | 39. So n +2 is a positive divisor of 39 greater or equal to 3, which gives n=1,11,37. Therefore, sum is 49.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's important that n is positive integer, so n +2 must be at least 3. So seems okay.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, here's a catch. The Remainder Theorem says that if n +2 divides f(n), then f(-2)=0 mod (n +2). So f(-2)=39. Therefore, 39 \u22610 mod (n +2). Which means that n +2 divides 39. But this is a necessary condition. Is it also sufficient? That is, if n +2 divides 39, then n +2 divides f(n). Let's check. Take n +2=3. Then n=1. Then f(n)=3*(4)*(1 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120 /3=40. Yes. If n +2=13, n=11. f(n)=3*14*(121 +9)=3*14*130=5460. 5460 /13=420. Yes. If n +2=39, n=37. f(n)=3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378=165360. 165360 /39=4240. Correct. And n +2=1, n=-1, which is not positive. Therefore, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. Therefore, the only solutions are n=1,11,37. Therefore, the answer should be 1+11+37=49.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Wait, hold on. Let me check n=4. n=4. n +2=6. 6 divides 39? No. So not a solution. But suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). If n +2 divides the product, but n +2 might have factors that divide different parts of the product. For example, n +2=6. Factors 2 and 3. If 2 divides one term and 3 divides another. Let's see. For n=4: 6 divides 3*(7)*(25). 3 divides the first term, and 2 divides the second term 7? No, 7 is odd. 2 divides the last term? n\u00b2 +9=25, which is odd. So 2 doesn't divide the product. Wait, 3*7*25=525. Which is 525/6=87.5, not integer. So no. So even though n +2=6 has factors that divide different parts, but since 2 doesn't divide the product, it doesn't work.\n\nBut wait, here's a thought. Suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). So n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Since n +2 divides this product, but n +2 may not be prime, so n +2 could have prime factors which divide different components. But according to the Remainder Theorem approach, regardless of the factors, n +2 must divide 39. Therefore, even if n +2 had prime factors not dividing 39, but according to the theorem, n +2 must divide 39. So seems like the only solutions are those n's where n +2 divides 39.\n\nWait, but let's take n +2= 3*13=39. Which we have. So according to this, only those three n's. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait, but in general, if we have that n +2 divides f(n), and f(n) \u2261 c mod n +2, then n +2 divides c. So in our case, c=39. So yes, n +2 divides 39. Therefore, n +2 must be a divisor of 39. Therefore, only those three. So conclusion: sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but here's another angle. Suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's write n +2 | 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's denote d = n +2. Then n = d -2. Then substituting:\n\nd | 3(d +1)( (d -2)^2 +9 ) = 3(d +1)(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Then, since d divides that expression. Then, as before, d divides 3*1*13=39. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, no. Wait, we have d divides 3(d +1)(d\u00b2 -4d +13). So d divides 3(d +1)(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Since gcd(d, d +1)=1, as before, then d divides 3(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Then, since d divides 3(d\u00b2 -4d +13), then d divides 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Let's write 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13) = 3d\u00b2 -12d +39. Then, since d divides each term 3d\u00b2, 12d, so d divides 39. Therefore, d divides 39. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, d divides 39, so d | 39. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nSo this confirms again that only d=3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37.\n\nWait, so unless I made an error in these deductions, the answer should be 49. However, I recall that sometimes in these problems, especially when dealing with divisors, sometimes the divisor can be a divisor of a multiple of 39. Wait, but in this case, the logic seems pretty tight. Let me check with another example. Suppose n +2 divides 39, so n +2=3, then n=1. If n +2=13, n=11. If n +2=39, n=37. If n +2=1, n=-1. So that's all. So unless there's a divisor I'm missing.\n\nWait, 39's divisors are 1,3,13,39. Negative divisors are -1,... but n positive. So no. So only those three. Hmm.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose n +2 divides 39. So n +2 divides 39. But 39=3*13. So divisors are combinations of 3 and 13. So 3^1*13^1. So total divisors are (1+1)(1+1)=4. Which are 1,3,13,39. So yes, only four. So n +2=3,13,39. So n=1,11,37.\n\nWait, but let's check n=1. Then n +2=3 divides 3*(4)*(1 +9)=3*4*10. 3 divides 3, so obviously yes. But more importantly, the remaining factors 4*10=40, so 3 divides 3*40, which is 120. Which is divisible by 3. Similarly, n=11: n +2=13. Then 13 divides 3*(14)*(121 +9)=3*14*130. 14 is 14, 130 is divisible by 13, so yes. Similarly n=37: n +2=39 divides 3*40*1378. 3 divides 3, 39 divides 3*40*1378. Since 39 divides 3*(13*3.07...), wait. Wait, 39=13*3. So 3 divides 3, 13 divides 1378? Let's check n=37: n\u00b2 +9=1369 +9=1378. 1378 divided by13: 13*100=1300, 1378-1300=78, 78/13=6. So 13*106=1378. Therefore, 13 divides n\u00b2 +9 when n=37. Therefore, 39 divides 3*(40)*(13*106). 39=3*13. 3 divides 3, 13 divides 13, and 40 and 106 remain. So yes, divisible by 39.\n\nSimilarly, in n=11: n +3=14, which is not divisible by 13, but n\u00b2 +9=130, which is 13*10. So 13 divides n\u00b2 +9. So in that case, the factor of 13 comes from n\u00b2 +9. In n=1: n +3=4, n\u00b2 +9=10, so the factor of 3 comes from the leading 3. So depending on n, different factors contribute. So the fact that n +2 divides 39 ensures that n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). But according to our analysis, these are the only solutions.\n\nWait, but let's suppose that there exists some n +2 which divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) even if n +2 doesn't divide 39. Suppose, for example, n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). If n +2 has a common factor with n +3 or n\u00b2 +9. For example, gcd(n +2,n +3)=1, since gcd(n +2, n +3)=gcd(n +2,1)=1. Similarly, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9). Let's compute gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13), where d = n +2. Wait, we did this earlier. gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13)=gcd(d,13). So gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13)=gcd(d,13). Therefore, gcd is 1 or 13.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(n +2, 3) is either 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) implies that n +2 divides 3* gcd(n +2, n +3)*gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9). But since gcd(n +2, n +3)=1, and gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(d,13). Therefore, n +2 divides 3*1*gcd(d,13). Therefore, n +2 divides 3*1*13 or 3*1*1. Wait, no:\n\nWait, more accurately: Since n +2 divides 3*(n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9), and since gcd(n +2, n +3)=1, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9) is either 1 or 13. Therefore, n +2 divides 3*1*(n\u00b2 +9) but gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(d,13). So n +2 divides 3*13=39. Wait, this might be another way to get that n +2 divides 39.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's consider that n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Since gcd(n +2, n +3)=1, then n +2 divides 3(n\u00b2 +9). Then, n +2 divides 3(n\u00b2 +9). Let's write this as n +2 divides 3(n\u00b2 +9). Let's compute gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9). Let's compute gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13), where d =n +2. As before, gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13)=gcd(d, (-4d +13))=gcd(d,13). Therefore, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(d,13). Therefore, since n +2 divides 3(n\u00b2 +9), and gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9) divides 13, so we can write n +2 divides 3*13=39. Therefore, n +2 divides 39. Which again gives the same conclusion. Therefore, n +2 divides 39. Therefore, n +2 \u2208 {1,3,13,39}, leading to n=1,11,37. So this confirms again the same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we end up with n +2 divides 39, leading to only three solutions. Therefore, the answer should be 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but wait. Let me check n=4 again. Wait, but according to the above logic, n +2 divides 39. So n +2 must be 3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. So unless the logic is flawed, these are the only solutions.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let's check n=13. n=13, n +2=15. Check if 15 divides 3*(16)*(169 +9)=3*16*178=8544. 8544 divided by 15: 15*569=8535, 8544-8535=9. Not divisible. So n=13 not a solution. Which is good, since n +2=15 which doesn't divide 39.\n\nWait another check. Suppose n +2 divides 39. So n +2=3,13,39. All others, like n +2= -3, etc., are irrelevant. So only those three. So n=1,11,37.\n\nBut here's a thought. Let's take d=3,13,39. For each d, check gcd(d,3) and gcd(d,13). For example, d=3: gcd(3,3)=3, gcd(3,13)=1. So since n +2 divides 3*1*13, okay. For d=13: gcd(13,3)=1, gcd(13,13)=13. So divides 3*13. For d=39: gcd(39,3)=3, gcd(39,13)=13. So divides 3*13. Therefore, all these d divide 3*13=39. Which is consistent.\n\nBut in the previous step, we had that n +2 divides 3*13=39. Which is why all n +2 must divide 39.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: the only solutions are n=1,11,37. Sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the sum of all positive integers n\". So unless there is a larger n which divides, but according to the logic, n +2 must divide 39, so n +2 is at most 39. Therefore, n=37 is the largest possible. So 39 divides the product, but 39 is the n +2=39. So all possibilities exhausted.\n\nBut to be 100% sure, let's check n=1,11,37 and see.\n\nn=1: 3 divides 3*(4)*(10). 3 divides 120. Yes.\n\nn=11:13 divides 3*14*130. 13 divides 3*14*130. Since 13 divides 130, yes.\n\nn=37:39 divides 3*40*1378. 39 divides 3*40*1378. Since 39=13*3. 3 divides 3, and 13 divides 1378 (as 1378 /13=106). Therefore, yes.\n\nSo all three work. Therefore, the answer is 1+11+37=49.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Wait, I just thought of something. Let's suppose that n +2 divides 39, so n +2 divides 39. But 39 has factors 3,13,39. But wait, 39 is 3*13, so in general, if we have n +2 divides 39, n +2 can be any divisor, positive, so 1,3,13,39, but n positive. So n +2 must be at least 3. So n=1,11,37.\n\nBut let's suppose n +2=3^k*13^m, but since 39 is 3^1*13^1, so exponents are 0 or 1. So divisors are combinations: 3^0*13^0=1, 3^1*13^0=3, 3^0*13^1=13, 3^1*13^1=39. So that's all. So no more divisors.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a higher exponent, but 39 is square-free. So no.\n\nTherefore, I think this is thorough. Therefore, the answer should be 49.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, it's possible that n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9), but even if n +2 has factors that divide different parts of the product. But according to the logic above, regardless of that, n +2 must divide 39, which caps the possible n's. So unless there is a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, but let's suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Then n +2 divides 39. But how exactly? Let's recap:\n\nBy the remainder theorem, when we divide f(n) by n +2, the remainder is f(-2)=3*(1)*(4 +9)=3*1*13=39. Therefore, n +2 divides f(n) iff n +2 divides 39. Therefore, this is a theorem. Therefore, this is a necessary and sufficient condition. Therefore, only n +2 divides 39. Therefore, only n +2 in {3,13,39}, so n=1,11,37.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 49. So unless the problem is from somewhere else, but according to all deductions, this should be correct.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me check n=4 again. Wait, but according to our conclusion, n=4 (d=6) is not a solution, which is correct. Wait, but let's suppose n +2= 3*3=9, which divides 9 divides 39? No, 9 doesn't divide 39. 39=3*13. So n +2=9 is not a divisor of 39, so n +2=9 not allowed, so n=7 not a solution, which we checked earlier.\n\nAlternatively, n +2= 3*13=39, which we have.\n\nWait, unless... Wait, unless there is a divisor of 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) which is equal to n +2, but n +2 could divide into the product non-trivially. But according to the remainder theorem approach, n +2 divides f(n) iff n +2 divides 39, which is a constant. So regardless of n, the only way n +2 divides f(n) is if n +2 divides 39. So this seems to be a solid conclusion. Therefore, answer is 49.\n\nBut to make sure, let's check n=2. n +2=4. 4 divides 3*(5)*(4 +9)=3*5*13=195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75. Not integer. Correct.\n\nWait, n=5: n +2=7. 3*7*(25 +9)=3*7*34. 3*7*34=714. 714 /7=102. Wait, wait, hold on! Wait, n=5: n +2=7 divides 3*(5 +3)*(25 +9)=3*8*34=816. 816 divided by7: 7*116=812. 816-812=4. Not divisible. Wait, wait, but wait, according to my calculation above, 3*7*34=714. Wait, wait, wait, no:\n\nWait, n=5: f(n)=3*(5 +3)*(5\u00b2 +9)=3*8*34=3*272=816. Yes. Which divided by 7 is 116.571..., not integer. So previous calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, so 3*8*34=24*34=816. 816 /7=116.571... Not integer. So n=5 not a solution.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. If I take n +2=7, which does not divide 39, so not a solution. So okay.\n\nWait, n=10: n +2=12. Check if 12 divides 3*13*109. 3*13=39, 39*109=4251. 4251 /12=354.25. Not integer.\n\nWait, n=6: n +2=8. 3*9*45=1215. 1215 /8=151.875. Not integer.\n\nWait, n=7: n +2=9. 3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.333... Not integer.\n\nWait, n=8: n +2=10. 3*11*73=2409. 2409 /10=240.9. Not integer.\n\nn=9: n +2=11. 3*12*90=3240. 3240 /11\u2248294.545... Not integer.\n\nn=10: done before.\n\nn=12: done. n=13: done.\n\nn=14: n +2=16. 3*15*205=9225. 9225 /16=576.5625. Not integer.\n\nn=15: n +2=17. 3*16*(225 +9)=3*16*234=11232. 11232 /17=660.705... Not integer.\n\nWait, n=16: n +2=18. 3*17*265=13515. 13515 /18=750.833... No.\n\nn=17: n +2=19. 3*18*(289 +9)=3*18*298=16092. 16092 /19=847. So wait: 19*800=15200. 16092-15200=892. 19*47=893. Close. 19*847= (19*800)+(19*47)=15200+893=16093. Which is one more than 16092. So remainder 1. Not divisible.\n\nWait, so n=17 not a solution.\n\nWait, n=18: n +2=20. 3*19*(324 +9)=3*19*333=18981. 18981 /20=949.05. Not integer.\n\nWait, n=25: n +2=27. 3*28*(625 +9)=3*28*634=53256. 53256 /27=1972.444... Not integer.\n\nWait, n=11 works. n=37 works. Seems like only three solutions. So unless my mind is missing something, answer is 49.\n\nBut to cross-verify, let's see. Let's check n=1: 1+2=3 divides 3*(4)*(1+9)=3*4*10. 3 divides 3, done.\n\nn=11:13 divides 3*(14)*(121 +9)=3*14*130. 13 divides 130, so yes.\n\nn=37:39 divides 3*(40)*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378. 39 divides 3*40*1378. 39 divides 3*40*1378. Since 39=13*3. 3 divides 3, and 13 divides 1378 (as 13*106=1378). So yes.\n\nBut here's a different n. Let's suppose n= -1: n +2=1. But n must be positive.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let's suppose n +2 divides 39. Then n +2 could be 3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. But if the problem had said all integers, then negative divisors, but since n positive, only these.\n\nAlternatively, suppose n +2 divides 39, so n +2 could be 3,13,39, or also 3*13* etc. But no, divisors are only 1,3,13,39.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9), and n +2 divides 39. But 39 is equal to 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) mod n +2. Wait, but according to the remainder theorem, it's fixed. So regardless, it's 39. So conclusion still holds.\n\nAlternatively, suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's write this as:\n\n(n +2) | 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's write n\u00b2 +9 as n\u00b2 +9 = (n\u00b2 -4) +13 = (n -2)(n +2) +13. Therefore, n\u00b2 +9 \u2261 13 mod (n +2). Similarly, n +3 = (n +2) +1, so n +3 \u22611 mod (n +2). Therefore, the entire expression:\n\n3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u2261 3*(1)*(13)=39 mod (n +2). Therefore, 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u226139 mod (n +2). Therefore, n +2 divides 39. Exactly. Therefore, this is another way to see that.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we end up with n +2 divides 39. Therefore, only three solutions. Therefore, answer 49.\n\nBut to be 100% sure, let's check n=1,11,37 again.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 3*(4)*(1 +9)=120. 120/3=40. Yes.\n\nFor n=11:\n\nCheck if 13 divides 3*(14)*(121 +9)=3*14*130. 3*14=42. 42*130=5460. 5460 /13=420. Yes.\n\nFor n=37:\n\nCheck if 39 divides 3*(40)*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378. 3*40=120. 120*1378=165,360. 165360 /39=4240. Yes.\n\nAll three work. No other n's work up to n=40. Seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1+11+37=49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n's. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. So, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nWhich means that n + 2 divides evenly into 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). To find all such positive integers n, maybe we can use the concept of divisibility here. Let me recall that if a divides b, then b mod a = 0. So, another way to look at this is that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by n + 2 must be an integer. \n\nSince n + 2 divides this product, perhaps we can use the Remainder Theorem or factor theorem here. Wait, the Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when a polynomial f(n) is divided by n - a is f(a). But here, we have division by n + 2, which is n - (-2). So, maybe if we consider the polynomial part of the product, we can evaluate at n = -2?\n\nWait, but the expression here is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me think. If we consider the entire expression as a polynomial in n, then the remainder when dividing by n + 2 would be obtained by substituting n = -2. Therefore, the remainder is 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. Therefore, the remainder is 39. Since we want n + 2 to divide this product, the remainder must be zero. Therefore, 39 must be divisible by n + 2. Wait, so n + 2 divides 39?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check this logic again. The Remainder Theorem tells us that the remainder when f(n) is divided by n - a is f(a). Here, our divisor is n + 2 = n - (-2), so a = -2. Then, f(n) is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then f(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 39. Therefore, the remainder when dividing by n + 2 is 39, so in order for n + 2 to divide f(n), we must have that 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39.\n\nTherefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39. But n is a positive integer, so n + 2 must be an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n \u2265 1). Therefore, we can list all positive divisors of 39, subtract 2 from each, and check which ones are positive integers. Then sum those n's.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm this logic. If n + 2 divides f(n), then f(n) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). But according to the Remainder Theorem, this is equivalent to saying that f(-2) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Since f(-2) = 39, so 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39. Since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3. So divisors of 39 greater than or equal to 3.\n\nBut 39 factors into 1 * 39, 3 * 13. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n + 2 must be at least 3, the possible divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 = 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. Then sum them up: 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. But wait, is that all? Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is this logic entirely correct? Because sometimes when dealing with divisibility, even if the remainder is 39, n + 2 divides 39, but n + 2 could also divide the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) for other reasons? Hmm. Wait, but according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when dividing the polynomial f(n) by n + 2 is 39, so in order for n + 2 to divide f(n), the remainder must be zero. Therefore, n + 2 must divide 39. Therefore, the only possible n + 2 are divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39, but since n is positive, n + 2 must be at least 3, so n + 2 = 3, 13, 39. So n = 1, 11, 37. Therefore, sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with n=1. Let's plug in n=1. Then n + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Then 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So that works.\n\nn=11. n + 2=13. Product is 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9)=3*14*(121 + 9)=3*14*130=3*1820=5460. Then 5460 divided by 13: 13*420=5460. Yes, that works.\n\nn=37. n + 2=39. Product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9)=3*40*(1369 + 9)=3*40*1378=3*55120=165360. Divided by 39: 39*4240=165,360. So yes, that works.\n\nWait, but is there a case where n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? Because maybe n + 2 divides the product even if it doesn't divide 39? Hmm. Wait, but according to the logic above, if n + 2 divides the product, then n + 2 divides 39. Because the remainder is 39, so 39 must be congruent to 0 mod n + 2, hence n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, this should be the only possible n's. But let me check n=2. For example, n=2. Then n + 2=4. Then product is 3*(5)*(4 + 9)=3*5*13=195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75, which is not integer, so n=2 is excluded, which is correct.\n\nn=4. n + 2=6. Product is 3*(7)*(16 + 9)=3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5, not integer. So n=4 excluded.\n\nWait, n=5. n + 2=7. Product: 3*8*(25 + 9)=3*8*34=816. 816 /7 \u2248 116.57, not integer. So n=5 not good.\n\nWait, n=7. n + 2=9. Product: 3*10*(49 + 9)=3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.33, not integer.\n\nWait, n=10. n + 2=12. Product: 3*13*(100 + 9)=3*13*109=4251. 4251 /12=354.25, not integer.\n\nWait, so so far, only n=1,11,37 work, so sum 49. But wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, but 39 has negative divisors too. But since n is positive, n + 2 must be positive, so we don't need to consider negative divisors.\n\nWait, but here's a thought. Suppose that even though n + 2 divides 39, but in reality, because the original expression is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), maybe some factors could cancel out? Wait, but the logic of the Remainder Theorem seems solid here. If we have n + 2 divides f(n), then f(n) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), which implies that 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, only divisors of 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be in {3,13,39}, hence n in {1,11,37}, sum 49.\n\nBut wait, let me check n=0. Wait, n must be positive, so n=0 is excluded.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The Remainder Theorem gives that the remainder is 39. Therefore, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = (n + 2)*q(n) + 39, where q(n) is the quotient polynomial. Therefore, if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, the logic is correct. Therefore, only n + 2 divides 39. So n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39 greater than 2. So divisors are 3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. Sum is 49.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Suppose n + 2 divides 39. So n + 2 could be 3,13,39. But 39's divisors are also 1,3,13,39. So n + 2 could be each of those, but n positive: n + 2 \u2265 3. So n + 2=3,13,39. So n=1,11,37. So sum 49. Seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there is a mistake here. Because in the expression, the coefficient of the polynomial is multiplied by 3. Wait, but in the Remainder Theorem, we substituted n=-2 into the entire expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), so that gives 3*(1)*(13)=39. So regardless of the coefficients, that should be the remainder.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we try to manipulate the expression. Let's say we have n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, equivalently, there exists integer k such that 39 = k*(n + 2), but wait, no. Wait, actually, since the remainder is 39, then n + 2 divides 39. So that should be the case.\n\nWait, but here's an alternative approach. Let's consider that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Since n is a positive integer, d must be an integer greater or equal to 3. Substitute n = d - 2 into the expression:\n\nWe need d divides 3(d - 2 + 3)((d - 2)^2 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d divides this product. But since d divides this product, we can write that d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since d divides this, and gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, because consecutive integers are coprime. Similarly, gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let's compute gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let's compute gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = gcd(d, (-4d + 13)) = gcd(d, 13). Because gcd(d, -4d +13) = gcd(d, (-4d +13) +4*d) = gcd(d, 13). Therefore, gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13) is either 1 or 13.\n\nTherefore, since d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), and since gcd(d, d + 1)=1, gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13)=gcd(d,13), then d divides 3*1*13=39. Therefore, d divides 39. Which brings us back to d | 39, so d is a positive divisor of 39, which is the same conclusion as before. Therefore, d \u2208 {1,3,13,39}, but since d \u22653, d \u2208 {3,13,39}, leading to n=1,11,37. So sum 49.\n\nTherefore, seems like the answer is 49. Hmm. But wait, but wait, in this alternative approach, they also considered that d divides 3*1*13, but why exactly?\n\nWait, the logic here is that since d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 -4d +13), and since d is coprime with (d + 1), then d divides 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Then, since gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13)=gcd(d,13), so if 13 divides d, then gcd is 13, otherwise 1. Therefore, if we factor d into its prime factors, considering that d divides 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13), but since gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13) divides 13, then d divides 3*13. Wait, no:\n\nWait, actually, the conclusion is that d divides 3 * gcd(d, d + 1) * gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13). But since gcd(d, d +1 )=1, so then d divides 3 * gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13). Since gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13) divides 13, then gcd(d, d\u00b2 -4d +13) is either 1 or 13, so d divides 3 * 1 or 3 * 13. Therefore, d divides 39. Therefore, this shows that d divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nSo this confirms the previous result. Therefore, seems like 49 is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me check n=4. Wait, n=4, n +2=6. Then 3*(7)*(16 + 9)=3*7*25=525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5, not integer. So n=4 not good. If n + 2 divides 39, n=1,11,37. But if we didn't have the factor of 3 in the original expression, would we have different divisors? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that even though n + 2 divides 39, but because of the factor 3 in front, perhaps n + 2 could divide 13? Wait, but according to the previous analysis, no. Wait, in the first approach, we saw that the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39 regardless of the factor 3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine the Remainder Theorem approach.\n\nLet f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then f(-2) = 3*(1)*(4 + 9) = 39, as before. Therefore, f(n) \u2261 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, if n + 2 divides f(n), then n + 2 divides 39. This seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, suppose n + 2 divides f(n), then n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). Therefore, we can substitute n = -2 into f(n) to get f(n) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Which gives 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 3*(1)*(4 + 9) = 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. So this method also gives the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, seems like the only solutions are n = 1, 11, 37, sum to 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check n=12. Wait, n + 2=14, which is not a divisor of 39, but let's check if it divides. n=12: 3*(15)*(144 + 9)=3*15*153=3*2295=6885. Divided by 14: 6885 /14 \u2248 491.785..., not integer. So nope.\n\nWait, n=2. Already checked. Hmm. Wait, n=3. n + 2=5. Product: 3*(6)*(9 + 9)=3*6*18=324. 324 /5=64.8, not integer.\n\nWait, n=5. 3*8*(25 + 9)=3*8*34=816. 816 /7\u2248116.57, nope.\n\nWait, n=6. n + 2=8. 3*9*(36 +9)=3*9*45=1215. 1215 /8=151.875. Not integer.\n\nWait, n=7. n + 2=9. 3*10*58=1740. 1740 /9=193.333...\n\nn=8: n + 2=10. 3*11*(64 +9)=3*11*73=2409. 2409 /10=240.9.\n\nn=9: n + 2=11. 3*12*(81 +9)=3*12*90=3240. 3240 /11\u2248294.545...\n\nn=10: n + 2=12. 3*13*109=4251. 4251 /12=354.25.\n\nn=12: checked.\n\nn=13: n + 2=15. 3*15*(169 +9)=3*15*178=8010. 8010 /15=534. So wait, 8010 divided by 15 is 534. So this is an integer. Wait, hold on! n=13, n + 2=15 divides 3*(16)*(169 +9). Wait, wait, n=13: n + 3=16, n\u00b2 +9=169 +9=178. So product is 3*16*178=3*2848=8544? Wait, wait, wait, no:\n\nWait, wait, wait, wait. Wait n=13:\n\nn + 3=16, n\u00b2 +9=169 +9=178. Then product is 3*(16)*(178)=3*16*178. Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, 16*178: 10*178=1780, 6*178=1068, so total 1780+1068=2848. Then 3*2848=8544.\n\nn + 2=15. 8544 divided by 15: 15*500=7500, 8544 -7500=1044. 15*69=1035, 1044-1035=9. So 500 +69=569 with remainder 9. So 8544 /15=569.6. Not integer. Wait, my mistake earlier. So n=13 does not work.\n\nWait, so why did I think n=13 gives 8010? Because I miscalculated. So no, n=13 does not work. Then why did I get confused?\n\nWait, n=13: n + 2=15. 3*(n + 3)=3*16=48, times (n\u00b2 +9)=178. 48*178. Let's compute 48*100=4800, 48*70=3360, 48*8=384. So 4800 + 3360=8160 + 384=8544. So same as above. 8544 /15=569.6. Not integer.\n\nWait, okay. So previous calculation is correct. Then n=13 doesn't work.\n\nWait, but here's a problem. According to our previous logic, n + 2 must divide 39, but 15 does not divide 39, so n=13 is excluded. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let's check n=4. Wait, n=4, n + 2=6. The product is 3*(7)*(16 +9)=3*7*25=525. 525 /6=87.5. Not integer. So okay.\n\nWait, n=5: 3*(8)*(25 +9)=3*8*34=816. 816 /7\u2248116.57. Not integer.\n\nWait, but here's a different idea. Let's suppose that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, since n + 2 divides this product, and n + 2 and n + 3 are coprime? Wait, because n + 3 - (n + 2)=1. Therefore, gcd(n + 2, n + 3)=1. Similarly, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 +9). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm:\n\ngcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9 - n*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 +9 -n\u00b2 -2n) = gcd(n + 2, -2n +9). Then:\n\ngcd(n + 2, -2n +9) = gcd(n + 2, (-2n +9) + 2*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, (-2n +9) +2n +4)=gcd(n +2,13). Therefore, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(n +2,13).\n\nTherefore, gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9) is either 1 or 13.\n\nSimilarly, since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and gcd(n + 2, n + 3)=1, we have that n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 +9). Then, since gcd(n +2, n\u00b2 +9)=gcd(n +2,13), we have that n +2 divides 3*13=39. Which again leads us to n +2 divides 39. So same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we get that n +2 divides 39, so n +2 is a positive divisor of 39 greater or equal to 3. Therefore, n +2=3,13,39, n=1,11,37. Sum is 49.\n\nTherefore, unless there's some miscalculation in my reasoning, this should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check n=1 again. n=1: n +2=3 divides 3*(4)*(1 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120 /3=40, yes.\n\nn=11: 13 divides 3*14*(121 +9)=3*14*130=5460. 5460 /13=420. Correct.\n\nn=37: 39 divides 3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378=165,360. 165,360 /39: 39*4000=156,000. 165,360-156,000=9,360. 39*240=9,360. So total 4000 +240=4240. Correct.\n\nSo all three check out. So unless there are other divisors I'm missing.\n\nWait, but wait, 39 has divisors 3,13,39, but wait, 39=3*13. So divisors are 1,3,13,39. So we have considered all. Therefore, n +2=3,13,39. So n=1,11,37.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check n= -1. Wait, n must be positive. So no. n=0 invalid.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: sum is 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait a second. Wait, in the problem statement, it's the product 3(n+3)(n\u00b2 +9). So the 3 is multiplied in. So when we considered the remainder theorem, we substituted n=-2 into the entire expression 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Which gives 3*(1)*(4 +9)=39. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't have the factor 3, then remainder would have been 13, and divisors of 13. But in our problem, the factor of 3 is present, leading to 39.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of n + 2 dividing 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 39. So unless there's some case where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39. Wait, according to the Remainder Theorem logic, the remainder is 39, so if n +2 divides the expression, the remainder must be zero, so n +2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other n's. Therefore, answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, to be thorough, let's suppose n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Then:\n\nWe can write that:\n\n3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u22610 mod (n +2)\n\nBut n \u2261 -2 mod (n +2), so substitute n=-2:\n\n3( (-2) +3 ) ( (-2)^2 +9 ) \u22613(1)(13)=39\u22610 mod (n +2). So n +2 divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nThus, I think the answer is indeed 49. Therefore, the sum is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n"

        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n's. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In math terms, that means that when you divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there's no remainder. So, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\nn + 2 | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\n\nWhich is equivalent to saying that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) mod (n + 2) = 0.\n\nI remember that when dealing with divisibility conditions like this, sometimes it's helpful to use the concept of modular arithmetic. Specifically, if we can find the remainder when 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divided by n + 2, and set that equal to zero, we can solve for n.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to perform polynomial division or use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial f(n) divided by (n - a) is f(a). But here, the divisor is n + 2, which is equivalent to n - (-2). So, if I consider the polynomial f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then the remainder when f(n) is divided by n + 2 is f(-2). Therefore, if n + 2 divides f(n), then f(-2) must be zero. Wait, but f(-2) would be 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. So, 39 is the remainder? But that would mean that the remainder is 39, so for n + 2 to divide f(n), 39 must be congruent to 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check that again. If I have f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then f(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. Therefore, by the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when f(n) is divided by n + 2 is 39. Therefore, for n + 2 to divide f(n), n + 2 must divide 39. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39. Since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies n + 2 \u2265 3). Therefore, the positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n + 2 \u2265 3, we can exclude 1. Therefore, possible values of n + 2 are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n would be 1, 11, 37. Then the sum would be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Wait, but is that all?\n\nBut hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The Remainder Theorem says that if you divide f(n) by (n + 2), the remainder is f(-2). Therefore, if n + 2 divides f(n), then f(-2) must be 0. However, in this case, f(-2) is 39, not 0. Therefore, that would mean that n + 2 divides 39? Wait, no, actually, the remainder is 39. So, if we have that f(n) divided by n + 2 leaves a remainder of 39. Therefore, for n + 2 to divide f(n), the remainder must be zero. Therefore, 39 must be congruent to 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39. Since n is a positive integer, n + 2 is at least 3, so the divisors of 39 greater or equal to 3 are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, so n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. Then sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. But wait, is that all? Are there other possibilities?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Because the problem says that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder is 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. However, is there a case where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? For example, if n + 2 shares some common factors with the other terms?\n\nWait, no. Because if we have that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) and also, from the remainder, we have that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = q(n)(n + 2) + 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Because if n + 2 divides the left-hand side, then it must divide the right-hand side, which is q(n)(n + 2) + 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the only possible n are 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the sum is 49.\n\nBut let me check with actual numbers. Let's check n = 1. Then n + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Then 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So yes, 3 divides 120. Good.\n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. The product is 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let's compute that: 3*14 is 42, 42*130 = 5460. Now divide by 13: 5460 / 13. Let me compute 13*420 = 5460. So yes, 13 divides 5460. Good.\n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. The product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let me compute that. 3*40 = 120. 120*1378. Let me divide 120*1378 by 39. Let me see if 39 divides 120*1378. Well, 39 = 13*3. Let's check if 13 and 3 divide 120*1378.\n\nFirst, 3 divides 120*1378: 120 is divisible by 3, so yes. Then 13 divides 120*1378? Let's check 120 mod 13: 13*9 = 117, so 120 - 117 = 3. So 120 \u2261 3 mod 13. 1378 divided by 13: 13*106 = 1378? Let me check 13*100 = 1300, 13*6 = 78, so 13*106 = 1300 + 78 = 1378. So 1378 \u2261 0 mod 13. Therefore, 120*1378 \u2261 3*0 = 0 mod 13. Therefore, 13 divides 120*1378, so 39 divides 120*1378. Therefore, yes, 39 divides the product. So n = 37 is valid.\n\nTherefore, those three values are correct. But wait, are there other divisors? Let me check the divisors of 39 again. 39 factors into 3*13. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So we considered 3, 13, 39. But what about negative divisors? However, since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be positive, so we don't need to consider negative divisors. Therefore, only 3, 13, 39. Therefore, only n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But maybe there are other n where n + 2 divides that product even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? How can that be?\n\nWait, according to the earlier logic, since the remainder is 39, then n + 2 divides 39. So if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, only those three n's. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut let me check for n = 0. Wait, n must be positive, so n = 0 is excluded. What about n = 2? Let's check n = 2. Then n + 2 = 4. The product is 3*(2 + 3)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75, which is not integer. So no. How about n = 3? n + 2 = 5. The product is 3*(6)*(9 + 9) = 3*6*18 = 324. 324 divided by 5 is 64.8, not integer. n = 4: n + 2 = 6. Product: 3*(7)*(16 + 9) = 3*7*25 = 525. 525 / 6 = 87.5, nope. n = 5: n + 2 = 7. Product: 3*(8)*(25 + 9) = 3*8*34 = 816. 816 / 7 \u2248 116.57, not integer. n = 6: n + 2 = 8. Product: 3*(9)*(36 + 9) = 3*9*45 = 1215. 1215 / 8 = 151.875, nope. n = 7: n + 2 = 9. Product: 3*(10)*(49 + 9) = 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 / 9 = 193.333... nope. n = 8: n + 2 = 10. Product: 3*(11)*(64 + 9) = 3*11*73 = 234*11? Wait, 3*11 is 33, 33*73. Let me compute 33*70 = 2310, 33*3=99, total 2409. Divided by 10 is 240.9, not integer. n = 9: n + 2 = 11. Product: 3*(12)*(81 + 9) = 3*12*90 = 3240. 3240 divided by 11 is 294.545... nope. n = 10: n + 2 = 12. Product: 3*(13)*(100 + 9) = 3*13*109 = 3*1417 = 4251. Divided by 12: 4251 / 12 = 354.25, nope. So up to n=10, only n=1 works. Then n=11 works, as checked earlier. Then n=12: n + 2 = 14. Product: 3*(15)*(144 + 9) = 3*15*153 = 45*153. Let me compute 45*150 = 6750, 45*3 = 135, total 6885. Divided by 14: 6885 / 14 \u2248 491.78... nope. So seems like only 1, 11, 37 work.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check n=37. n + 2 = 39. Product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 120*1378. As before, 120*1378 divided by 39. Let me compute 120 / 39 = 3.07... but maybe factor it. 39 = 13*3. 120 = 3*40. Therefore, 3*40*1378 / (13*3) = 40*1378 / 13. Now 1378 divided by 13 is 106, as before. Therefore, 40*106 = 4240, which is integer. So yes, works.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. Maybe by expressing the divisibility condition as:\n\nLet me denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. So substitute into the product:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((d - 2) + 3)((d - 2)^2 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13)\n\nTherefore, we need d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). So, d | 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since d divides this expression, and d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). But since d divides this, and d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), but we can also note that d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). However, since d divides this, we can write that:\n\nLet me think. Since d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), then d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). But since d divides this, and d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), but also note that d divides 3*(something). However, maybe we can find some relation here.\n\nAlternatively, since d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), then d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). But since d divides this, then d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). However, since d divides this, and we can write that:\n\nLet me compute 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) mod d. Since we can reduce each term modulo d. Note that d \u2261 0 mod d, so:\n\n(d + 1) \u2261 1 mod d, and (d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 0 - 0 + 13 \u2261 13 mod d. Therefore, the entire expression is congruent to 3*1*13 = 39 mod d. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod d. Therefore, d divides 39. Which is the same conclusion as before. Therefore, d is a positive divisor of 39, and since d = n + 2 \u2265 3 (as n \u2265 1), so d \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, leading to n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. Therefore, same result.\n\nTherefore, seems like the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. However, let me check if there are other divisors. Wait, 39 is 3*13. So positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So we considered 3, 13, 39. But what about if d divides 39, but d is negative? But since d = n + 2 and n is positive integer, d must be at least 3, so no negative divisors. Therefore, only those three. Therefore, answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if there's a case where d divides 39 but also divides the product for some other reason. For example, if d divides 3, or d divides (d + 1), etc. But since d divides 39, and d is greater than 1, but since d divides 39, and 39 is 3*13, so the divisors are as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) even if d does not divide 39? But according to the above, since we have that 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 39 mod d, so d divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, only those three values.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose that d divides 39. Then, since d divides 39, then 39 = k*d for some integer k. Therefore, the remainder is zero. Therefore, that's exactly the condition. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.\n\nBut let me check for d = 3, 13, 39. For example, take d = 3. Then n = 1. As checked earlier, works. For d = 13, n = 11, works. For d = 39, n = 37, works. What about d = 1? Then n = -1, which is not positive, so excluded. Therefore, only those three.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach where we can write the divisibility condition as:\n\nn + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me write that as:\n\nThere exists integer k such that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = k(n + 2). But solving this equation for integers n and k seems difficult. However, perhaps we can manipulate the equation.\n\nAlternatively, since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me try to express n\u00b2 + 9 in terms of n + 2. Let me perform polynomial division or find a relation.\n\nNote that n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n \u2261 -2. Therefore, n + 3 \u2261 (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2). Similarly, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 3*1*13 = 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, same as before, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, seems like all roads lead to n + 2 divides 39, hence n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}, sum 49.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let me write the divisibility condition as:\n\nLet me denote m = n + 2. Then n = m - 2. Then the product becomes 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((m - 2) + 3)((m - 2)^2 + 9) = 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 4 + 9) = 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Therefore, m divides 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Therefore, m divides 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Let me write that as:\n\nm divides 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Which can be written as m divides 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Since m divides this, and m divides 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13), but m and m + 1 are coprime, since consecutive integers. Similarly, m and m\u00b2 - 4m + 13: Let me check gcd(m, m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Let me compute gcd(m, m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Since gcd(m, m\u00b2 - 4m + 13) = gcd(m, 13). Because m\u00b2 - 4m + 13 \u2261 0 - 0 + 13 = 13 mod m. Therefore, gcd(m, 13). Therefore, the gcd is either 1 or 13, depending on m.\n\nTherefore, since m divides 3*(m + 1)*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13), and since gcd(m, m + 1) = 1, and gcd(m, m\u00b2 - 4m + 13) divides 13, then m must divide 3*13. Wait, let me think.\n\nSince m divides 3*(m + 1)*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Since m and m + 1 are coprime, m must divide 3*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Because m divides 3*(m + 1)*(...), and since m and m + 1 are coprime, m divides 3*(...). Similarly, since gcd(m, m\u00b2 - 4m + 13) divides 13, then m can be written as a product of factors where one part divides 3 and the other divides 13 or something? Maybe this approach is more complicated, but let's try.\n\nSo m divides 3*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Therefore, m divides 3*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13). Let me write that as:\n\nThere exists integer k such that 3*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13) = k*m. Therefore, 3m\u00b2 - 12m + 39 = k*m. Therefore, 3m\u00b2 - (12 + k)m + 39 = 0. But this seems a quadratic in m, but not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, rearrange:\n\n3*(m\u00b2 - 4m + 13) \u2261 0 mod m. Which is equivalent to 3*(0 - 0 + 13) \u2261 0 mod m, since m\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod m, -4m \u2261 0 mod m. Therefore, 3*13 \u2261 0 mod m. Therefore, m divides 39. Which is the same conclusion as before. Therefore, m divides 39. Therefore, m \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39}, and since m = n + 2 \u2265 3, m \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, so n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}.\n\nTherefore, same result. Therefore, I think this is solid. Therefore, answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there's a case where m divides 39 but m is not in {3, 13, 39}. For example, m = 1, but n = -1, invalid. m = 3, 13, 39. So no others. Therefore, yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming that m divides 39. Let me think again. From the congruence, we have that 3*13 \u2261 0 mod m, so m divides 39. Therefore, m must be a divisor of 39. Therefore, yes.\n\nTherefore, conclusion is 49.\n\nBut wait, just to check for m = 39, which gives n = 37. Let me check if there's another way to see that. For example, if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me try to write n\u00b2 + 9 in terms of n + 2. For example, n\u00b2 + 9 = (n + 2)(n - 2) + 13. Because (n + 2)(n - 2) = n\u00b2 - 4, so n\u00b2 + 9 = n\u00b2 - 4 + 13 = (n + 2)(n - 2) + 13. Therefore, substituting back:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3(n + 3)[(n + 2)(n - 2) + 13] = 3(n + 3)(n + 2)(n - 2) + 3*13*(n + 3). Therefore, when divided by n + 2, the first term is divisible by n + 2, and the second term is 39(n + 3). Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by n + 2 if and only if 39(n + 3) is divisible by n + 2. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39(n + 3). Therefore, another way to write the condition is n + 2 divides 39(n + 3).\n\nSo now, we have n + 2 divides 39(n + 3). Let me write that as:\n\nLet me denote d = n + 2 again. Then d divides 39(n + 3). But since n = d - 2, then n + 3 = d - 2 + 3 = d + 1. Therefore, d divides 39(d + 1). Therefore, d divides 39(d + 1). Which implies that d divides 39(d + 1) - 39*d = 39. Therefore, d divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion. Therefore, d divides 39, so d \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39}, and since d \u2265 3, then same as before. Therefore, n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}.\n\nTherefore, this approach also leads to the same conclusion. Therefore, I think this is solid. Therefore, answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and perhaps get a different answer. For example, suppose someone tries to write the divisibility condition as:\n\nn + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me try to compute the GCD of n + 2 and the product. But since n + 2 and n + 3 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Similarly, n + 2 and n\u00b2 + 9. Let me check gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Let me compute gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Using Euclidean algorithm:\n\ngcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9 - n*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9 - n\u00b2 - 2n) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9). Then, gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9 + 2*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9 + 2n + 4) = gcd(n + 2, 13). Therefore, the gcd is either 1 or 13, depending on whether n + 2 divides 13.\n\nTherefore, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) is 1 or 13. Therefore, since n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9), and since gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, and gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) is 1 or 13, then n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9) implies that n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*something, where the something is either 1 or 13. Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.\n\nBut since gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, then n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Because n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9) and gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = 1, so n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, as before, since gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) is 1 or 13, then n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). If gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, then n + 2 divides 3. If gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = 13, then n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) / 13. But this seems more complicated.\n\nBut let's try. So, n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me write that as:\n\nLet me use the same substitution, d = n + 2. Then, d divides 3*( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ) = 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Which again, as before, reduces to d divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion. Therefore, regardless of the approach, we end up with d divides 39.\n\nTherefore, this seems to confirm again that the only solutions are n = 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the sum is 49.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there's any other possible divisors. For example, suppose that d divides 39, but d is not in {3, 13, 39}. For example, d = 1, but n = -1 invalid. What about d = 3*13 = 39, which we have. What about d = 3* something? Well, 39 is 3*13, so the divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So no others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a case where even though d does not divide 39, but because of the 3 in front, it somehow divides? But according to the previous reasoning, no. Because when we reduced the expression modulo d, we found that it's congruent to 39, so d must divide 39. Therefore, there's no way around that.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 49. Therefore, I think the final answer is \\boxed{49}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n's. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem in my own words. We have n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, mathematically, that means that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2) should be an integer. So, I need to find all positive integers n where this division results in an integer.\n\nOne way to approach divisibility problems is to use the concept of division with remainder or perhaps modular arithmetic. Alternatively, maybe polynomial division? Let me try to think.\n\nSince n + 2 divides the product, then n + 2 must be a divisor of 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, maybe I can express this as:\n\nLet me denote k = n + 2. Then n = k - 2. So, substituting back into the product:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) becomes 3((k - 2) + 3)((k - 2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(k + 1)((k\u00b2 - 4k + 4) + 9) = 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13).\n\nSo, we need k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). Therefore, k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). Since k divides this product, then k must divide 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). But since k divides the product, and k and k + 1 are coprime (because consecutive integers), maybe we can use that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write that 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 mod k. Which would mean that 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 mod k. Let me compute this modulo k.\n\nSince k \u2261 0 mod k, so any term with k can be simplified. Let me compute each part modulo k:\n\nFirst, (k + 1) \u2261 1 mod k.\n\nSecond, (k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 - 0 + 13 \u2261 13 mod k.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes 3 * 1 * 13 \u2261 39 mod k. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod k. Therefore, k divides 39.\n\nAh! So that means that k is a positive divisor of 39. But since k = n + 2, and n is a positive integer, then k must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies k = n + 2 \u2265 3). Wait, but 39 has positive divisors. Let me list all positive divisors of 39.\n\nFirst, prime factorization of 39 is 3 * 13. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut since k = n + 2 \u2265 3 (since n is positive integer, n \u2265 1, so k \u2265 3). Therefore, possible k values are 3, 13, 39. Wait, but 1 is excluded because k \u2265 3. However, hold on, maybe n can be zero? Wait, the problem says positive integers n, so n \u2265 1, so k = n + 2 \u2265 3. Therefore, k \u2208 {3, 13, 39}?\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other divisors? Wait 39 is 3*13, so divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So yes, only those. Therefore, k can be 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = k - 2 would be 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the possible n's are 1, 11, 37. Then the sum would be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Is that all?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if there are other possibilities. Because when I did the modular arithmetic, I concluded that k divides 39. But is that necessarily the case?\n\nLet me recap. We had that 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 39 mod k. Therefore, k divides 39. Therefore, k must be a positive divisor of 39. But since k \u2265 3, then k \u2208 {3, 13, 39}. Therefore, n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. Therefore, sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if there are other divisors? For example, negative divisors? But since k = n + 2 and n is positive, k must be positive. So negative divisors are not considered here. Therefore, only positive divisors. So 3, 13, 39. So n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut let me test these values to make sure.\n\nFirst, n = 1: n + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Then 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is integer. So that works.\n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. The product is 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let me compute 3*14 = 42, 42*130 = 5460. Then 5460 divided by 13 is 5460 / 13. Let me compute 13*420 = 5460. So yes, that works.\n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. The product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let me compute 3*40 = 120, 120*1378. Let me check if 120*1378 is divisible by 39. Let me compute 1378 divided by 13 first? Wait, 39 is 3*13. Let me check if 120*1378 is divisible by 3*13.\n\nWell, 120 is divisible by 3, so 120 = 3*40. So 3*40*1378 divided by 3*13 is (40*1378)/13. Let me compute 1378 divided by 13. 13*100 = 1300, 1378 - 1300 = 78. 78 /13 = 6. Therefore, 1378 /13 = 106. Therefore, (40*1378)/13 = 40*106 = 4240. Which is integer. Therefore, yes, 39 divides the product. So that works.\n\nBut wait, but are there other possible values? For example, suppose k divides 39, but maybe there are more divisors? Wait 39 is 3*13, so divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So only those. But let me think again about the logic.\n\nEarlier, I said that 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 39 mod k. Therefore, k divides 39. But is that correct?\n\nLet me check again. Let me compute 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k.\n\nSince k \u2261 0 mod k, then:\n\n(k + 1) \u2261 1 mod k\n\n(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 - 0 + 13 \u2261 13 mod k\n\nTherefore, multiplying together: 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod k. Therefore, 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 39 mod k. Therefore, for this to be congruent to 0 mod k, we need 39 \u2261 0 mod k, i.e., k divides 39. Therefore, that logic is correct.\n\nTherefore, k must be a positive divisor of 39, and since k \u2265 3, then k \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut wait, hold on. What if k divides 39, but maybe there are other constraints? For example, suppose k divides 39, but maybe there are some cases where even though k divides 39, the original divisibility condition isn't satisfied? Wait, but we derived that k divides 39 is necessary and sufficient? Let me check.\n\nSuppose k divides 39, then 39 \u2261 0 mod k, so 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 mod k, which implies that k divides the product. Therefore, the condition is equivalent to k divides 39. Therefore, all such k are exactly the divisors of 39, and since n is positive, k \u2265 3. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, let me check another divisor. For example, k = 1. If k = 1, then n = -1, which is not positive. Similarly, k = 3, 13, 39. So those are the only ones.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possible values. Suppose that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Maybe there are other n's where n + 2 divides that product even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? How can that be?\n\nWait, according to the previous logic, if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. So unless there is a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose that k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). But we said that k divides 39. However, is it possible that even if k doesn't divide 39, but because of some factors in (k + 1) or (k\u00b2 - 4k + 13), the product is still divisible by k? But according to the modular arithmetic, we have that 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 39 mod k, so if k divides that product, then 39 \u2261 0 mod k, so k divides 39. Therefore, the conclusion is that k must divide 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, our initial conclusion is correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me test another value. Let me pick a k that does not divide 39, say k = 2. Then n = 0, which is not positive. k = 4. Let me check if 4 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) where n = 2. So n = 2, n + 2 = 4. The product is 3*(2 + 3)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75, which is not integer. So 4 does not divide 195. So that's consistent with our conclusion.\n\nAnother example: k = 6. Let me check n = 4. n + 2 = 6. The product is 3*(4 + 3)*(16 + 9) = 3*7*25 = 525. 525 divided by 6 is 87.5, not integer. So 6 doesn't divide 525. So again, consistent.\n\nWhat about k = 3, which divides 39. n = 1, which works. How about k = 13, n = 11, works. k = 39, n = 37, works.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other divisors. For example, if k is a divisor of 39, but negative? But since k = n + 2 and n is positive, k must be at least 3, so negative divisors are irrelevant.\n\nWait, but what if n + 2 is a divisor of 39 but larger than 39? For example, 39 has divisors only up to 39. So no, 39 is the largest. So no.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose that k divides 39, but k could be 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. But wait, let me check another thing. What if k divides 39, but k is a divisor that is not in {3, 13, 39}? For example, 1. But n = -1, which is invalid. So no. Therefore, yes, only those three.\n\nBut hold on. Let me check n = 0, even though it's not positive. For n = 0, n + 2 = 2. Then the product is 3*(0 + 3)*(0 + 9) = 3*3*9 = 81. 81 divided by 2 is 40.5, not integer. So no.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe there are values where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? But according to our modular arithmetic, that's not possible. Because we showed that if n + 2 divides the product, then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other solutions.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the modular arithmetic? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2). Let me perform polynomial division or express it as a function.\n\nAlternatively, let me write n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). Therefore, substituting n \u2261 -2 into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me compute this modulo (n + 2).\n\nSo, n \u2261 -2, so:\n\nn + 3 \u2261 (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2)\n\nn\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2)\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, for (n + 2) to divide the product, we need 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), i.e., n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, this seems solid. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39, and since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3, so divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. Sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe factorizing the expression?\n\nLet me try to write 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2). Maybe perform the division?\n\nLet me try to divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2). Let me first expand the numerator.\n\nFirst, expand (n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9):\n\n= n(n\u00b2 + 9) + 3(n\u00b2 + 9)\n\n= n\u00b3 + 9n + 3n\u00b2 + 27\n\n= n\u00b3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n= 3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81\n\nNow, divide this by (n + 2). Let me perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide 3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81 by n + 2.\n\nFirst term: 3n\u00b3 / n = 3n\u00b2. Multiply (n + 2) by 3n\u00b2: 3n\u00b3 + 6n\u00b2. Subtract from the original polynomial:\n\n(3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81) - (3n\u00b3 + 6n\u00b2) = 3n\u00b2 + 27n + 81.\n\nNext term: 3n\u00b2 / n = 3n. Multiply (n + 2) by 3n: 3n\u00b2 + 6n. Subtract:\n\n(3n\u00b2 + 27n + 81) - (3n\u00b2 + 6n) = 21n + 81.\n\nNext term: 21n / n = 21. Multiply (n + 2) by 21: 21n + 42. Subtract:\n\n(21n + 81) - (21n + 42) = 39.\n\nTherefore, the division gives 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 21 with a remainder of 39. Therefore,\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = (n + 2)(3n\u00b2 + 3n + 21) + 39.\n\nTherefore, for (n + 2) to divide the product, the remainder must be zero. Therefore, 39 must be divisible by (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Which is exactly the same conclusion as before. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39, and since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3. Hence, the same result. Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nTherefore, I think this confirms that the answer is 49.\n\nBut just to check, let me think if there's a case where n + 2 divides 39 but n is not positive? For example, n + 2 = 1, which would give n = -1, which is invalid. Similarly, n + 2 = -1, n = -3, invalid. So no. Therefore, only n + 2 = 3, 13, 39.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Therefore, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n's. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In mathematical terms, that means that when you divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there's no remainder. So, (n + 2) | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nI remember that if a number a divides another number b, then b mod a is 0. So, maybe I can use polynomial division or the remainder theorem here? Let me recall the remainder theorem: if you have a polynomial f(n) and you divide it by (n - c), the remainder is f(c). But here, the divisor is n + 2, which is like n - (-2). So, if I consider the polynomial f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then the remainder when dividing by n + 2 would be f(-2). If that remainder is zero, then n + 2 divides f(n). \n\nWait, but is f(n) a polynomial? Let me check. Yes, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is a polynomial in n. So, according to the remainder theorem, if I plug in n = -2 into f(n), the result should be zero if n + 2 divides f(n). Let me compute that:\n\nf(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3(1)(13) = 39. \n\nBut 39 is not zero. Hmm, so that suggests that n + 2 doesn't divide f(n) for all n? But the question says \"find the sum of all positive integers n such that...\" So, maybe my approach is missing something?\n\nWait, no. The remainder theorem tells us that the remainder when f(n) is divided by n + 2 is 39. Therefore, for n + 2 to divide f(n), the remainder must be zero. But since the remainder is 39, that would mean that n + 2 divides 39. Because if you have a division where the remainder is 39, then for the division to be exact (no remainder), n + 2 must be a divisor of 39. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose we have f(n) divided by (n + 2) gives a quotient q(n) and remainder r. So f(n) = (n + 2)q(n) + r. Then, when n = -2, f(-2) = 0*q(-2) + r => r = f(-2) = 39. Therefore, if we want (n + 2) to divide f(n), then the remainder must be zero, so 39 must be zero modulo (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. \n\nYes! So that means n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39. But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be an integer greater than 2 (since n \u2265 1, so n + 2 \u2265 3). Therefore, the positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n + 2 must be at least 3, the possible values of n + 2 are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n would be 1, 11, 37. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if that's all. But 39 has divisors 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n + 2 must divide 39, and n is positive, n + 2 must be in {3, 13, 39}. Therefore, n is 1, 11, 37. Then, the sum would be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut wait, is that all? Let me check if there are other possibilities. Because maybe there's a case where even though n + 2 doesn't divide 39, but because of the 3 in the product, maybe there's some cancellation? Wait, no. Because according to the division algorithm, the remainder is fixed as 39. Therefore, for (n + 2) to divide f(n), it must divide 39. So, the only possibilities are n + 2 divides 39. \n\nBut let me verify with n = 1. Let's check if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9). Compute 3*(4)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So that works. \n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. Compute 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*(14)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let me compute 3*14 = 42, 42*130 = 5460. Now divide by 13: 5460 /13. Let me compute 13*420 = 5460. So yes, that works. \n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. Compute 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let me compute 3*40 = 120, 120*1378. Now divide by 39. Let me check if 120*1378 is divisible by 39. Let me see: 39 divides 120*1378? Well, since 39 divides 3*40*1378, but 39 is 3*13. So, 3 divides 3*... so that's okay. But does 13 divide 40*1378? Let me check 40*1378. 1378 divided by 13: 13*106 = 1378? Let me check 13*100 = 1300, 13*6 = 78, so 13*106 = 1378. Yes! Therefore, 40*1378 = 40*13*106. Therefore, 3*40*1378 = 3*40*13*106. Therefore, dividing by 39 = 3*13 gives 40*106, which is integer. So yes, that works. \n\nSo n = 1, 11, 37. Sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. But wait, hold on. Are there any other divisors? For example, negative divisors? But since n is positive, n + 2 is positive, so we don't need to consider negative divisors. \n\nBut let me check if there are other divisors. 39 factors into 3 * 13. So positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n is 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut wait, hold on. What if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), but not necessarily that n + 2 divides 39? Is there a possibility that n + 2 divides the product even if it doesn't divide 39? Because maybe there's some common factors? \n\nWait, but according to the remainder theorem, the remainder is 39. Therefore, if n + 2 divides f(n), then n + 2 divides 39. Because f(n) = (n + 2)*q(n) + 39. Therefore, if n + 2 divides f(n), then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, only n + 2 in {3, 13, 39}, so n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut let me check with another approach to be safe. Maybe using modular arithmetic. \n\nWe need n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). \n\nLet me note that n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). Therefore, substitute n = -2 into the expression. \n\nSo 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. So same conclusion. \n\nTherefore, only n + 2 divides 39, so n + 2 \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39}, but since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3, so n + 2 \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, so n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. \n\nTherefore, sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if there are other possible divisors. For example, suppose n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but maybe n + 2 is 3*13 = 39, which we have considered. But what if n + 2 is a divisor that is not necessarily coprime with the other terms? But according to the above reasoning, regardless of other factors, the remainder is 39, so n + 2 must divide 39. \n\nBut let me think of an example. Let me take n = 1. Then n + 2 = 3. 3 divides 3*(4)*(10) = 120. Yes, 120 / 3 = 40. \n\nWhat if n + 2 is 1? Then n = -1, which is not positive. So we can ignore that. \n\nWhat if n + 2 is 3, 13, 39. So n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut maybe there are other n where even though n + 2 doesn't divide 39, but because of the 3 in the product, maybe there's some cancellation? Wait, but according to the modular arithmetic, the congruence reduces to 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, regardless of other factors, n + 2 must divide 39. \n\nSo, I think that is the only condition. Therefore, the answer should be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut let me check for n = 7. Let's see, n + 2 = 9. Does 9 divide 3*(10)*(49 + 9) = 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 divided by 9: 9*193 = 1737, remainder 3. So no. So 9 does not divide 1740. So n = 7 is not a solution. \n\nAnother example, n = 5. n + 2 = 7. Compute 3*(8)*(25 + 9) = 3*8*34 = 816. 816 divided by 7: 7*116 = 812, remainder 4. Not divisible. \n\nHow about n = 2? n + 2 = 4. Compute 3*(5)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75. Not integer. \n\nn = 3: n + 2 = 5. 3*(6)*(9 + 9) = 3*6*18 = 324. 324 / 5 = 64.8. Not integer. \n\nn = 4: n + 2 = 6. 3*(7)*(16 + 9) = 3*7*25 = 525. 525 / 6 = 87.5. Not integer. \n\nn = 6: n + 2 = 8. 3*(9)*(36 + 9) = 3*9*45 = 1215. 1215 / 8 = 151.875. Not integer. \n\nn = 8: n + 2 = 10. 3*(11)*(64 + 9) = 3*11*73 = 2343. 2343 / 10 = 234.3. Not integer. \n\nn = 9: n + 2 = 11. 3*(12)*(81 + 9) = 3*12*90 = 3240. 3240 / 11 \u2248 294.54... Not integer. \n\nn = 10: n + 2 = 12. 3*(13)*(100 + 9) = 3*13*109 = 4251. 4251 / 12 = 354.25. Not integer. \n\nn = 12: n + 2 = 14. 3*(15)*(144 + 9) = 3*15*153 = 6885. 6885 / 14 \u2248 491.78... Not integer. \n\nn = 13: n + 2 = 15. 3*(16)*(169 + 9) = 3*16*178 = 8544. 8544 / 15 = 569.6. Not integer. \n\nn = 14: n + 2 = 16. 3*(17)*(196 + 9) = 3*17*205 = 10455. 10455 / 16 \u2248 653.4375. Not integer. \n\nn = 15: n + 2 = 17. 3*(18)*(225 + 9) = 3*18*234 = 12636. 12636 / 17 \u2248 743.29... Not integer. \n\nn = 16: n + 2 = 18. 3*(19)*(256 + 9) = 3*19*265 = 15255. 15255 / 18 = 847.5. Not integer. \n\nn = 17: n + 2 = 19. 3*(20)*(289 + 9) = 3*20*298 = 17880. 17880 / 19 \u2248 941.05... Not integer. \n\nn = 18: n + 2 = 20. 3*(21)*(324 + 9) = 3*21*333 = 21*999 = 20979. 20979 / 20 = 1048.95. Not integer. \n\nn = 19: n + 2 = 21. 3*(22)*(361 + 9) = 3*22*370 = 66*370 = 24420. 24420 / 21 = 1162.857... Not integer. \n\nn = 20: n + 2 = 22. 3*(23)*(400 + 9) = 3*23*409 = 69*409 = 28101. 28101 / 22 \u2248 1277.318... Not integer. \n\nSo up to n = 20, only n = 1, 11, 37 work. Wait, but n = 37 is larger. Let me check n = 37. \n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. As before, 3*(40)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Which is 120*1378. Divided by 39. As before, 1378 divided by 13 is 106, so 120*13*106 divided by 39 (which is 3*13) is 120*106 / 3 = 40*106 = 4240. Which is integer. So yes, works. \n\nBut maybe there are other n? For example, n + 2 could be a divisor of 39, but maybe negative? But since n is positive, n + 2 is at least 3, so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me think. \n\nLet me write that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me denote d = n + 2. Then, n = d - 2. Substitute into the expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((d - 2) + 3)((d - 2)^2 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nSo, d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut since d divides this product, and d and d + 1 are coprime (consecutive integers), so d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBecause d and d + 1 are coprime, so d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nTherefore, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me compute that. \n\nSo, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me write this as:\n\n3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = 3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39. \n\nSo, d divides 3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39. \n\nBut since d divides 3d\u00b2 - 12d, then d divides (3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39) - (3d\u00b2 - 12d) = 39. \n\nTherefore, d divides 39. \n\nSo, same conclusion! Therefore, d is a positive divisor of 39, and since d = n + 2 \u2265 3, then d \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, so n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and maybe get different answers. For example, maybe considering the original expression and trying to find n such that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) implies that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) - k(n + 2) for any integer k. Maybe choosing k such that the expression simplifies. \n\nFor example, let me try to write 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) in terms of n + 2. Let me note that n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 3 \u2261 (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2). Similarly, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 3*1*13 = 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, same as before. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. \n\nSo, same conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to factor the expression or find relations. Let me think. \n\nBut since we have already confirmed through multiple approaches that n + 2 must divide 39, and that gives us n = 1, 11, 37, and checked some examples, I think that is solid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check n = 37 again. \n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. Compute 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 120*1378. Now, 1378 divided by 13 is 106, as before. So 120*13*106 divided by 39 (which is 3*13) gives 120*106 / 3 = 40*106 = 4240. Which is integer. \n\nAnother check: Let me take n + 2 = 3, so n = 1. Then 3*(1 + 3)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40. \n\nn + 2 = 13, n = 11: 3*(11 + 3)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130 = 3*14*130. 14*130 = 1820, 3*1820 = 5460. Divided by 13: 5460 / 13 = 420. \n\nSo yes, all correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 49. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all positive integers $ n $ is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n's. Alright, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. \n\nFirst, n is a positive integer, so n \u2265 1. The condition is that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. So, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\nn + 2 | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\n\nWhich means that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by n + 2 is an integer. \n\nI remember that if a number a divides another number b, then b mod a = 0. So, another way to think about this is that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Maybe I can use modular arithmetic here. \n\nAlternatively, I can perform polynomial division or use the remainder theorem. Since n + 2 is a linear term, maybe substituting n = -2 into the polynomial would give the remainder? Wait, the remainder theorem says that if you divide a polynomial f(n) by n - a, the remainder is f(a). But here, we have n + 2, which is n - (-2). So, if I consider the polynomial f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then the remainder when dividing by n + 2 is f(-2). \n\nBut since n + 2 divides f(n), the remainder should be zero. Therefore, f(-2) = 0. Let me check that.\n\nCalculating f(-2):\n\nf(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3 * 1 * 13 = 39. \n\nWait, so according to the remainder theorem, the remainder is 39. But we want the remainder to be zero. So this suggests that 39 must be congruent to 0 mod (n + 2). Which means that n + 2 divides 39. \n\nAh! So n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39. Since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1, so n + 2 \u2265 3). Therefore, the positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n + 2 \u2265 3, the possible values of n + 2 are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n would be 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39. However, since n is positive, n + 2 can't be 1. So divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut hold on, is that all? Let me check. Because the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 is in {1, 3, 13, 39}. But n is positive, so n + 2 \u2265 3, so n + 2 \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, hence n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. \n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if there are other possibilities? Because sometimes when dealing with divisibility, there might be cases where even if the remainder isn't zero, the divisibility holds because of factors in the original expression. But according to the remainder theorem, if n + 2 divides f(n), then f(-2) must be zero. But here, f(-2) is 39. Therefore, the only way for n + 2 to divide 39 is if n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, the conclusion is that n + 2 is a divisor of 39. \n\nBut let me test with n = 1. Let's check if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So that works. \n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. Let's compute 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let's divide that by 13. 3*14*130 /13 = 3*14*10 = 420, which is integer. \n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. Compute 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Divided by 39: Let's see. 3*40*1378 / 39. Simplify 3/39 = 1/13. So 40*1378 /13. Let me compute 1378 divided by 13. 13*100 = 1300, 1378 - 1300 = 78, 78 /13 = 6. So total is 100 + 6 = 106. Then 40*106 = 4240. Which is integer. So that works. \n\nBut wait, are there any other divisors? For example, negative divisors? But since n is positive, n + 2 is positive, so we don't need to consider negative divisors. \n\nBut 39 has divisors 1, 3, 13, 39. So that's all. Therefore, the possible n's are 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem says \"the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\". So maybe there are other cases where n + 2 divides this product even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? Because maybe n + 2 shares some factors with the other terms? \n\nWait, but according to the remainder theorem, if n + 2 divides f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then f(-2) must be 0. But f(-2) is 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Because if n + 2 divides f(n), then f(-2) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). But f(-2) is 39, so 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), meaning n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, the only solutions are n + 2 being divisors of 39. \n\nBut let me check with n = 1. Let me check if there are other n's. For example, suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Maybe n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39? How?\n\nWait, for example, suppose n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me think of n + 2 as d. Then d divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But since d = n + 2, we can express n = d - 2. Therefore, substituting back, d divides 3(d - 2 + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ). Simplify:\n\nd divides 3(d + 1)( (d\u00b2 - 4d + 4) + 9 ) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nSo d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut since d divides this expression, and d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). However, since d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), but d and d + 1 are coprime? Because consecutive integers are coprime. Similarly, d and d\u00b2 - 4d + 13? Let's see. \n\nLet me think. Let me compute gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me compute gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Since gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = gcd(d, (d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) - d*(d - 4)) = gcd(d, 13). Therefore, the gcd is either 1 or 13. \n\nTherefore, if d divides 3*(d + 1)*(something whose gcd with d is 1 or 13). Therefore, perhaps we can write that d divides 3*(d + 1)*something, but since gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, then d divides 3*(something). \n\nBut the something is d\u00b2 - 4d + 13. But since gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) is either 1 or 13, then:\n\nCase 1: If gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = 1, then d divides 3*(d + 1). But since gcd(d, d + 1) = 1, then d divides 3. Therefore, d is a divisor of 3. \n\nCase 2: If gcd(d, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = 13, then 13 divides d. Let me denote d = 13k. Then, since gcd(13k, d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = 13. Let me check. \n\nBut maybe this approach is getting too complicated. However, note that earlier, using the remainder theorem, we found that d divides 39. But according to this approach, if we consider d divides 3*(d + 1)*(something), and depending on gcds, we might have different cases. \n\nBut maybe there's a conflict here? Because according to the remainder theorem, we have that d divides 39. But according to this other approach, maybe there are more possibilities? Let me check.\n\nWait, let's take d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me compute this expression modulo d. Since d divides this expression, then:\n\n3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) \u2261 0 mod d. \n\nBut modulo d, d \u2261 0, so d + 1 \u2261 1, and d\u00b2 - 4d + 13 \u2261 0 - 0 + 13 = 13. Therefore, the expression is 3*1*13 = 39 \u2261 0 mod d. Therefore, d divides 39. \n\nAh! Therefore, this approach also leads us to the conclusion that d divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, the only possible d's are the positive divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since d = n + 2 \u2265 3, then d can be 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut let me check if there are other divisors. Wait, 39 is 3*13. So positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So that's all. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nFor n = 1: n + 2 = 3 divides 3*(4)*(10) = 120. 120 / 3 = 40. Yes.\n\nFor n = 11: n + 2 = 13 divides 3*(14)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. 3*14*130 / 13 = 3*14*10 = 420. Yes.\n\nFor n = 37: n + 2 = 39 divides 3*(40)*(37\u00b2 + 9). Let me compute 37\u00b2: 37\u00b2 = 1369. 1369 + 9 = 1378. Then 3*40*1378. Divided by 39: 3*40*1378 / 39 = (3/39)*40*1378 = (1/13)*40*1378. Now, 1378 divided by 13: 13*100 = 1300, 1378 - 1300 = 78, 78 /13 = 6. So total is 100 + 6 = 106. Then 40*106 = 4240. Which is integer. So yes, works. \n\nBut wait, what about n = 0? Although n must be positive, so n = 0 is excluded. But if n = 0, n + 2 = 2. Then check if 2 divides 3*(3)*(0 + 9) = 3*3*9 = 81. 81 divided by 2 is 40.5, which is not integer. So no. \n\nWhat about n = 2? n + 2 = 4. Check if 4 divides 3*(5)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 / 4 = 48.75. Not integer. \n\nn = 3: n + 2 = 5. Check 3*(6)*(9 + 9) = 3*6*18 = 324. 324 / 5 = 64.8. Not integer.\n\nn = 4: n + 2 = 6. Check 3*(7)*(16 + 9) = 3*7*25 = 525. 525 / 6 = 87.5. Not integer.\n\nn = 5: n + 2 = 7. 3*(8)*(25 + 9) = 3*8*34 = 816. 816 / 7 \u2248 116.57. Not integer.\n\nn = 6: n + 2 = 8. 3*(9)*(36 + 9) = 3*9*45 = 1215. 1215 / 8 = 151.875. Not integer.\n\nn = 7: n + 2 = 9. 3*(10)*(49 + 9) = 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 / 9 = 193.333... Not integer.\n\nn = 8: n + 2 = 10. 3*(11)*(64 + 9) = 3*11*73 = 2343. 2343 / 10 = 234.3. Not integer.\n\nn = 9: n + 2 = 11. 3*(12)*(81 + 9) = 3*12*90 = 3240. 3240 / 11 \u2248 294.545... Not integer.\n\nn = 10: n + 2 = 12. 3*(13)*(100 + 9) = 3*13*109 = 4251. 4251 / 12 = 354.25. Not integer.\n\nn = 11: already checked, works.\n\nn = 12: n + 2 = 14. 3*(15)*(144 + 9) = 3*15*153 = 6885. 6885 /14 \u2248 491.785... Not integer.\n\nSo seems like only n = 1, 11, 37 work. \n\nBut let me check n = 37. Wait, 37 is quite big. Let me check another value. For example, n = 13: n + 2 = 15. Check 3*(16)*(169 + 9) = 3*16*178 = 8544. 8544 / 15 = 569.6. Not integer. \n\nn = 14: n + 2 = 16. 3*(17)*(196 + 9) = 3*17*205 = 10485. 10485 /16 \u2248 655.3125. Not integer.\n\nn = 15: n + 2 = 17. 3*(18)*(225 + 9) = 3*18*234 = 12636. 12636 /17 \u2248 743.29. Not integer.\n\nn = 16: n + 2 = 18. 3*(19)*(256 + 9) = 3*19*265 = 15255. 15255 / 18 = 847.5. Not integer.\n\nn = 17: n + 2 = 19. 3*(20)*(289 + 9) = 3*20*298 = 17880. 17880 /19 \u2248 941.05. Not integer.\n\nn = 18: n + 2 = 20. 3*(21)*(324 + 9) = 3*21*333 = 21*999 = 20979. Divided by 20: 20979 /20 = 1048.95. Not integer.\n\nn = 19: n + 2 = 21. 3*(22)*(361 + 9) = 3*22*370 = 24420. Divided by 21: 24420 /21 = 1162.857... Not integer.\n\nn = 20: n + 2 = 22. 3*(23)*(400 + 9) = 3*23*409 = 28347. Divided by 22: 28347 /22 \u2248 1288.5. Not integer.\n\nSo up to n = 20, only n = 1, 11 work. Then n = 37 is next. Let me check n = 37. \n\nBut maybe there are other divisors? Wait, 39 is 3*13, so divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut let me check if there are other divisors if we consider that maybe n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39. But according to our previous reasoning, since f(-2) = 39, then n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me write n + 2 = d. Then, as before, d divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But since n = d - 2, substitute:\n\nd divides 3(d - 2 + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nSo, d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut since d divides this product, and since d and d + 1 are coprime, then d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nTherefore, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me write that as:\n\nThere exists integer k such that 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) = k*d. \n\nBut also, since d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13), then d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut note that d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) implies that d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) - 3d*(d - 4). Let me compute that:\n\n3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) - 3d*(d - 4) = 3d\u00b2 - 12d + 39 - 3d\u00b2 + 12d = 39. \n\nTherefore, d divides 39. \n\nSo this shows that d divides 39. Therefore, the same conclusion as before. Therefore, there are no other solutions. \n\nTherefore, the only possible n are 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut let me check if d = 3, 13, 39. \n\nFor d = 3: n = 1. \n\nFor d = 13: n = 11. \n\nFor d = 39: n = 37. \n\nSo sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other divisors if we consider that maybe d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) but not necessarily through the above steps. But according to the previous reasoning, since d divides 39, there are no other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation:\n\nn + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nThere exists integer k such that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = k(n + 2). \n\nBut solving this equation for integers n and k. However, this seems difficult directly. \n\nAlternatively, since we have already found solutions through the remainder theorem, and confirmed that they work, and shown that there are no other solutions, then 1, 11, 37 are the only solutions. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check n = 37. \n\nCompute 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) divided by (37 + 2). \n\nAs above, 3*(40)*(1369 + 9) / 39 = 3*40*1378 / 39. \n\nSimplify 3/39 = 1/13. So 40*1378 /13. \n\nCalculate 1378 divided by 13. \n\n13*100 = 1300. 1378 - 1300 = 78. 78 /13 = 6. So total 106. \n\nThen 40*106 = 4240. Which is integer. \n\nSo that works. \n\nIs there a possibility that n + 2 could be a divisor of 39 but negative? For example, n + 2 = -1, -3, -13, -39. But since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3, so negative divisors are irrelevant. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other divisors of 39. For example, 39 is 3 * 13. So divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So no others. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 49. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me check n = 37. Suppose someone says, maybe there's a larger n? For example, if n + 2 divides 39, but 39 is fixed. So n + 2 can't be larger than 39 unless... Wait, no. If n + 2 divides 39, then n + 2 must be one of the divisors of 39. Since 39 is fixed, there are no larger divisors. For example, 39's divisors are up to 39. So n + 2 can't be larger than 39 unless 39 is negative, which it isn't. Therefore, n + 2 can't be larger than 39. Therefore, n can't be larger than 37. \n\nTherefore, the only possible n's are 1, 11, 37. \n\nTherefore, the sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut let me check once more for n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nFor n = 1: 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3*(4)*(10) = 120. 120 / 3 = 40. Yes. \n\nFor n = 11: 11 + 2 = 13 divides 3*(14)*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. 3*14*130 / 13 = 3*14*10 = 420. Yes. \n\nFor n = 37: 37 + 2 = 39 divides 3*(40)*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. 3*40*1378 / 39 = (3/39)*40*1378 = (1/13)*40*1378. As calculated earlier, 1378 / 13 = 106. Then 40*106 = 4240. Yes. \n\nTherefore, all correct. \n\nHence, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all positive integers $ n $ is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "\nOkay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n's. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In mathematical terms, that means that when you divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2), there's no remainder. So, (n + 2) is a divisor of that product. \n\nI remember that if a number a divides another number b, then b mod a is 0. So maybe I can use modular arithmetic here. Let me try that. Let me denote k = n + 2. Then, n = k - 2. Maybe substituting n in terms of k would help? Let me try that.\n\nSo substituting n = k - 2 into the product:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) becomes 3((k - 2) + 3)((k - 2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(k + 1)((k\u00b2 - 4k + 4) + 9) = 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13).\n\nSo, the original condition is that k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). Therefore, k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). \n\nBut since k divides this product, then k must divide 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). However, since k divides itself, maybe I can use the property that if k divides a number, then that number mod k is 0. So, let me compute 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k.\n\nBut since we are working modulo k, any term with k in it will be 0. So let me compute each part modulo k:\n\nFirst, (k + 1) mod k is 1. Then, (k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k. Let's compute that:\n\nk\u00b2 mod k is 0, -4k mod k is 0, and 13 mod k is 13. Therefore, (k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k is 13. \n\nTherefore, the entire product mod k is 3 * 1 * 13 = 39. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod k. Which means that k divides 39. \n\nSo, k divides 39. Since k = n + 2, and n is a positive integer, then k must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies k \u2265 3). Also, since k divides 39, k must be a positive divisor of 39. \n\nSo, first, let me list all positive divisors of 39. The prime factorization of 39 is 3 * 13. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. However, since k \u2265 3, we can exclude 1. Therefore, possible values for k are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, or 39. Therefore, n can be 1, 11, 37. \n\nWait, but hold on. Is that all? Because I assumed that k divides 39, but is there a possibility that there are more divisors? Wait, 39 is 3*13, so divisors are indeed 1, 3, 13, 39. So, if k is 3, 13, or 39. Therefore, n is 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other possibilities. Because when I did the modular arithmetic, I concluded that k divides 39, but is there a possibility that even if k doesn't divide 39, but due to some factors in the other terms, the divisibility still holds? Wait, no. Because when I calculated 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k, I found it's equal to 39 mod k. Therefore, for that to be 0, k must divide 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. Therefore, the only possible k's are 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut let me check these values to make sure. Let me test n = 1. Then n + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Then 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So that works.\n\nn = 11: n + 2 = 13. The product is 3*(11 + 3)*(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let me compute 3*14 = 42, 42*130 = 5460. Then 5460 divided by 13: 13*420 = 5460. So yes, that works.\n\nn = 37: n + 2 = 39. The product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let me compute 3*40 = 120, 120*1378. Well, 1378 divided by 39... Wait, but since we already know that k = 39 divides 39, so 39 divides 3*(k + 1)*(...). But let me check if 39 divides 3*40*(...). Wait, but according to our earlier logic, since k divides 39, then 39 divides the product. But let me check numerically. \n\nAlternatively, since we have already established through modular arithmetic that if k divides 39, then the divisibility holds. So, if k = 39, then 39 divides 3*(k + 1)*(...). But maybe I can check the value. \n\nBut 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2) when n = 37 is 3*(40)*(37\u00b2 + 9)/39. Let me compute 37\u00b2: 37\u00b2 is 1369. 1369 + 9 = 1378. So 3*40*1378 / 39. Let me compute 3/39 = 1/13. Therefore, 40*1378 /13. Let me compute 1378 divided by 13. 13*100 = 1300, 1378 - 1300 = 78. 78 /13 = 6. Therefore, 1378 /13 = 106. Therefore, 40*106 = 4240. Which is an integer. So yes, that works. \n\nSo n = 37 is valid. \n\nBut wait, but the problem says \"positive integers n\". So n = 1, 11, 37. Are there any other possible values? Because maybe I missed some divisors?\n\nWait, 39 has divisors 1, 3, 13, 39. But k must be at least 3, since n is positive. So n \u2265 1 implies k = n + 2 \u2265 3. So yes, only 3, 13, 39. Therefore, the possible n's are 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that k divides 39, but k could be negative? But since n is a positive integer, k = n + 2 is at least 3, so no negative divisors. So that's covered. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me think again. Maybe there's a mistake in my modular arithmetic? Let me check again. \n\nOriginal problem: n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me write that as (n + 2) | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division or use the remainder theorem. Let me try that. \n\nIf I consider the polynomial f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). If I want to find when n + 2 divides f(n), then by the remainder theorem, the remainder when f(n) is divided by n + 2 is f(-2). Therefore, f(-2) should be 0. \n\nWait, but that would be if n + 2 divides f(n). However, in our case, the problem says that n + 2 divides f(n), which is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, the remainder when f(n) is divided by n + 2 is f(-2). Therefore, f(-2) must be 0. \n\nBut let me compute f(-2):\n\nf(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. \n\nSo, the remainder is 39. Therefore, for n + 2 to divide f(n), 39 must be 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. Which is exactly what I found earlier. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39, which is 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n is 1, 11, 37. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other divisors. For example, if n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but 39 also has divisors like... Well, 39 is 3*13, so positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So no others. \n\nBut hold on, what if n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but n + 2 could be negative? But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 is at least 3, so negative divisors are not considered. \n\nTherefore, the possible n's are 1, 11, 37, and their sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"sum of all positive integers n\". But let me check if there are other possible n's. For example, maybe n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) even if n + 2 does not divide 39? Is that possible?\n\nBut according to the remainder theorem, the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, there are no other possibilities. So I think that's thorough. \n\nBut let me try with n = 0, even though n must be positive. For n = 0, n + 2 = 2. Then 3*(0 + 3)*(0 + 9) = 3*3*9 = 81. 81 divided by 2 is 40.5, which is not integer. So n = 0 is invalid. \n\nWhat about n = 2? Then n + 2 = 4. The product is 3*(2 + 3)*(4 + 9) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 divided by 4 is 48.75, not integer. So no. \n\nn = 3: n + 2 = 5.

Product: 3*(10)*(49 + 9) = 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 / 9 = 193.333... Not integer. \n\nn = 8: n + 2 = 10. Product: 3*(11)*(64 + 9) = 3*11*73 = 234*11 = 2574. 2574 / 10 = 257.4. Nope. \n\nn = 9: n + 2 = 11. Product: 3*(12)*(81 + 9) = 3*12*90 = 3240. 3240 / 11 \u2248 294.54... Not integer. \n\nn = 10: n + 2 = 12. Product: 3*(13)*(100 + 9) = 3*13*109 = 3*1417 = 4251. 4251 / 12 = 354.25. Not integer. \n\nn = 11: which we already checked, works. \n\nSo seems like only n = 1, 11, 37 work. \n\nBut let me check n = 37 again. Maybe there's a mistake here. \n\nn = 37, n + 2 = 39. Product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let me compute 3*40 = 120. 120*1378. Well, 1378 divided by 39 is... Let me compute 39*35 = 1365. 1378 - 1365 = 13. So 1378 = 39*35 + 13. Therefore, 120*(39*35 + 13) = 120*39*35 + 120*13. Therefore, when divided by 39, the first term is divisible by 39, and the second term is 120*13. But 120*13 divided by 39 is (120/39)*13 = (40/13)*13 = 40. Therefore, total is 120*35 + 40, which is integer. Therefore, yes, divisible. \n\nSo that works. \n\nIs there a possibility that n + 2 could be a divisor of 39 but larger than 39? For example, if 39 has more divisors? But no, 39 is 3*13, so its positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So no larger ones. \n\nBut wait, what if n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but negative? For example, -1, -3, -13, -39. But since n is positive, n + 2 is at least 3, so negative divisors are irrelevant. \n\nTherefore, conclusion: n = 1, 11, 37. Sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me write this as:\n\n(n + 2) | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nAlternatively, since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and n + 2 and n + 3 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Similarly, n + 2 and n\u00b2 + 9? Let me check gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nLet me compute gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9). Using Euclidean algorithm:\n\ngcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9 - n(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9 - n\u00b2 - 2n) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9). Then, gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9 + 2*(n + 2)) = gcd(n + 2, -2n + 9 + 2n + 4) = gcd(n + 2, 13). \n\nTherefore, gcd(n + 2, n\u00b2 + 9) is either 1 or 13, depending on whether n + 2 divides 13. \n\nSimilarly, since n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and since gcd(n + 2, n + 3) = gcd(n + 2, 1) = 1, so n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nTherefore, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nSo, another approach: since n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me write that as:\n\nn + 2 | 3(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nAgain, using the same method, compute 3(n\u00b2 + 9) mod (n + 2). Let me substitute n = -2 into 3(n\u00b2 + 9). That would be 3((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(4 + 9) = 3*13 = 39. Therefore, the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Which is the same conclusion as before. \n\nTherefore, n + 2 divides 39. So again, same result. \n\nTherefore, this reinforces that the possible n's are 1, 11, 37. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other numbers where n + 2 divides 39. For example, if n + 2 is 3, 13, 39. \n\nBut 39 is 3*13, so divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. \n\nSo, yes, only those. \n\nBut let me think again: is there a case where even though n + 2 doesn't divide 39, but because of the 3 in front, maybe it works? For example, suppose n + 2 divides 3*(something). But according to the remainder theorem, the remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, even with the 3, it's still required that n + 2 divides 39. \n\nAlternatively, suppose that n + 2 divides 3*(something). But since we have that the remainder is 39, which is fixed, regardless of the 3. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original problem was that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). But when we did the remainder theorem, we found that the remainder is 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. \n\nBut if instead, we had considered that n + 2 divides 3*(something), then maybe there's a different way. But no, the remainder is fixed as 39. Therefore, regardless of the 3, the remainder is 39. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. \n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is correct. \n\nBut let me think of another approach. Let me write n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me denote d = n + 2. Then n = d - 2. Then:\n\nd divides 3*(d - 2 + 3)*((d - 2)^2 + 9) = 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nSo, d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut since d divides this product, and d and d + 1 are coprime (consecutive integers), so d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nSimilarly, since d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me write that as:\n\nd divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). \n\nBut d divides 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Let me compute 3*(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) mod d. \n\nAgain, d\u00b2 mod d is 0, -4d mod d is 0, 13 mod d is 13. Therefore, 3*(0 - 0 + 13) = 39. Therefore, d divides 39. \n\nSo again, same conclusion. Therefore, d is a positive divisor of 39, which is 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nTherefore, I think that's solid. \n\nBut just to check, suppose someone says, \"What if d divides 3*(something) where something is multiple of d?\" But no, because we have shown that the remainder is 39, so regardless of the other terms, the remainder is 39. Therefore, d must divide 39. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible divisors. For example, if 39 is considered with factors including 1, but n + 2 can't be 1 because n would be -1, which is not positive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed some divisors? Let me check 39 again. \n\nFactors of 39: 1, 3, 13, 39. Yes. \n\nAlternatively, if there are other divisors if we consider that maybe n + 2 divides 3*(n + 3)*(n\u00b2 + 9) but not necessarily that n + 2 divides 39. But according to the remainder theorem, it must. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that the remainder is 39? Let me check again with n = 1. \n\nFor n = 1, n + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40. So 3 divides 120. \n\nBut according to remainder theorem, f(-2) = 39, so 3 divides 39, which is true. \n\nSimilarly, for n + 2 = 13, which divides 39. 39 divided by 13 is 3. So yes. \n\nSame with 39. \n\nSo, all good. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 49. \n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me check if there's another approach. For example, writing the divisibility condition as:\n\nThere exists integer k such that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = k(n + 2). \n\nBut solving this equation for positive integers n and k. \n\nBut this might be more complex, but let me try. \n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nk = [3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)] / (n + 2). \n\nWe need this to be integer. \n\nLet me perform polynomial division on (n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2). \n\nFirst, expand (n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = n^3 + 9n + 3n\u00b2 + 27 = n^3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27. \n\nDivide this by (n + 2). \n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nDivide n^3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27 by n + 2. \n\nFirst term: n^3 / n = n\u00b2. Multiply (n + 2) by n\u00b2: n\u00b3 + 2n\u00b2. Subtract from dividend:\n\n(n\u00b3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27) - (n\u00b3 + 2n\u00b2) = (0n\u00b3) + (3n\u00b2 - 2n\u00b2) + 9n + 27 = n\u00b2 + 9n + 27. \n\nNext term: n\u00b2 / n = n. Multiply (n + 2) by n: n\u00b2 + 2n. Subtract:\n\n(n\u00b2 + 9n + 27) - (n\u00b2 + 2n) = 0n\u00b2 + 7n + 27. \n\nNext term: 7n / n = 7. Multiply (n + 2) by 7: 7n + 14. Subtract:\n\n(7n + 27) - (7n + 14) = 0n + 13. \n\nTherefore, the division gives: n\u00b2 + n + 7 with a remainder of 13. \n\nTherefore, (n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = (n + 2)(n\u00b2 + n + 7) + 13. \n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3(n + 2)(n\u00b2 + n + 7) + 39. \n\nTherefore, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) divided by (n + 2) is equal to 3(n\u00b2 + n + 7) + 39/(n + 2). \n\nTherefore, for this to be integer, 39/(n + 2) must be integer. Therefore, n + 2 divides 39. \n\nWhich again gives the same result. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39, which leads to n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nTherefore, this confirms again that the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nTherefore, I think confidently that the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n"

        "Okay, let's see. I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n. Hmm. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem states that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In mathematical terms, this means that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is a multiple of n + 2. So, there exists some integer k such that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = k(n + 2). My goal is to find all positive integers n for which this equation holds.\n\nOne approach I can think of is using polynomial division or the Remainder Theorem. If n + 2 divides the polynomial P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then when we divide P(n) by n + 2, the remainder should be zero. According to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder of dividing P(n) by (n - a) is P(a). But here, the divisor is (n + 2), which can be written as (n - (-2)). So, substituting n = -2 into P(n) should give the remainder. Let's compute that.\n\nCompute P(-2):\n\nP(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3 * 1 * 13 = 39.\n\nWait, so the remainder when P(n) is divided by n + 2 is 39. Therefore, for n + 2 to divide P(n), 39 must be divisible by n + 2. That is, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39. But n is a positive integer, so n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies n + 2 \u2265 3). Let me confirm this logic.\n\nSince the remainder is 39, then 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, for n + 2 to divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), it must divide the remainder 39. Therefore, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39, and since n is positive, n + 2 must be a divisor greater than 2 (since n \u2265 1, n + 2 \u2265 3). The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n + 2 \u2265 3, the possible divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, or 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's list all positive divisors of 39. 39 factors into 3 \u00d7 13, so the divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3. So, possible values for n + 2 are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 3 - 2 = 1, 13 - 2 = 11, 39 - 2 = 37. Therefore, the possible n are 1, 11, 37. Then, the sum of these is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, let me check if these actually satisfy the original condition. Let's test each n.\n\nFirst, n = 1:\n\nCheck if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40. So yes, 3 divides 120. Good.\n\nNext, n = 11:\n\n11 + 2 = 13. Compute 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130 = 3*14*130. Let's compute 14*130 = 1820. Then 3*1820 = 5460. Now, divide 5460 by 13: 5460 \u00f7 13. Let's see: 13*420 = 5460. So yes, 13 divides 5460. Good.\n\nNext, n = 37:\n\n37 + 2 = 39. Compute 3(37 + 3)(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let's compute step by step. 40*1378 = 55,120. Then 3*55,120 = 165,360. Divide 165,360 by 39: Let's see, 39*4240 = 39*(4000 + 240) = 156,000 + 9,360 = 165,360. So yes, 39 divides 165,360. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the possible n are indeed 1, 11, 37, and their sum is 49.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The logic here is that because the remainder when P(n) is divided by n + 2 is 39, then n + 2 must divide 39. But is this the only possibility? Let me confirm.\n\nSuppose that n + 2 divides 39. Then n + 2 is a divisor of 39, which gives the possible n as 1, 11, 37. But is there a case where even if n + 2 doesn't divide 39, n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) because the factors might cancel out?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when we apply the Remainder Theorem, the remainder is 39. Therefore, the divisibility condition is equivalent to n + 2 dividing 39. So, the possible n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39, hence the conclusion. Therefore, I think the answer is indeed 49.\n\nBut let me consider another approach to verify. Let's denote d = n + 2. Then, n = d - 2. Substitute into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9):\n\n3((d - 2) + 3)( (d - 2)^2 + 9 ) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 4 + 9) = 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13).\n\nWe need d to divide this expression. So, d divides 3(d + 1)(d\u00b2 - 4d + 13). Therefore, since d divides the product, and d and d + 1 are consecutive integers (thus coprime), d must divide 3 times the product of (d\u00b2 - 4d + 13) and 1 (since d and d + 1 are coprime). Wait, but d divides 3*(d + 1)*(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Since gcd(d, d +1) = 1, then d must divide 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Therefore, d divides 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13). Let me write this as:\n\n3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13) \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nSimplify 3*(d\u00b2 -4d +13) mod d:\n\nd\u00b2 mod d is 0, -4d mod d is 0, so 3*(0 - 0 +13) mod d = 3*13 mod d = 39 mod d. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod d. Therefore, d must divide 39. Which is exactly the same conclusion as before. Therefore, d is a positive divisor of 39, so d \u2208 {1,3,13,39}. But since n is positive, d = n + 2 \u2265 3, so d \u2208 {3,13,39}, leading to n =1,11,37. So this confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. So the sum is 49. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{49}.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's check with another method. Suppose we write the divisibility condition as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2).\n\nWe can substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). So, replacing n with -2 in the expression:\n\n3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*13 = 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Therefore, n + 2 divides 39, same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try to compute gcd(n + 2, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)). Since n + 2 divides the product, the gcd must be n + 2. But perhaps this approach is more complicated. The previous methods seem sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, let's express 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) in terms of (n + 2). Let's perform polynomial division or manipulate the expression.\n\nLet me expand 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9):\n\nFirst, multiply (n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9):\n\n= n(n\u00b2 + 9) + 3(n\u00b2 + 9)\n= n\u00b3 + 9n + 3n\u00b2 + 27\n= n\u00b3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n= 3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81\n\nNow, we need to divide this by (n + 2) and see when the remainder is zero. Let's perform polynomial long division.\n\nDivide 3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81 by n + 2.\n\nFirst term: 3n\u00b3 \u00f7 n = 3n\u00b2. Multiply (n + 2) by 3n\u00b2: 3n\u00b3 + 6n\u00b2. Subtract from the original polynomial:\n\n(3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81) - (3n\u00b3 + 6n\u00b2) = 3n\u00b2 + 27n + 81.\n\nNext term: 3n\u00b2 \u00f7 n = 3n. Multiply (n + 2) by 3n: 3n\u00b2 + 6n. Subtract:\n\n(3n\u00b2 + 27n + 81) - (3n\u00b2 + 6n) = 21n + 81.\n\nNext term: 21n \u00f7 n = 21. Multiply (n + 2) by 21: 21n + 42. Subtract:\n\n(21n + 81) - (21n + 42) = 39.\n\nSo the remainder is 39, which confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the division leaves a remainder of 39, so for the division to be exact, n + 2 must divide 39. Thus, the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the possible n + 2 are 3, 13, 39, leading to n =1,11,37. Sum is 49. So I'm confident that the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\), and then sum all those \\( n \\). \n\nFirst, let me understand what the problem is asking. We have an expression \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\), and we need \\( n + 2 \\) to be a divisor of this expression. In other words, when we divide \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\) by \\( n + 2 \\), there should be no remainder. \n\nSo, mathematically, this means:\n\\[\nn + 2 \\mid 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)\n\\]\nWhich implies that there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that:\n\\[\n3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = k(n + 2)\n\\]\nOur goal is to find all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying this condition and then add them up.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? One common method when dealing with divisibility is to use the division algorithm or modular arithmetic. Since we need \\( n + 2 \\) to divide the product, we can consider the expression modulo \\( n + 2 \\). If \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product, then the product modulo \\( n + 2 \\) should be 0.\n\nSo, let's compute \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\mod (n + 2) \\). To simplify this, I can substitute \\( n \\equiv -2 \\mod (n + 2) \\). That is, replace every instance of \\( n \\) with \\( -2 \\) in the expression.\n\nLet's do that step by step. First, substitute \\( n = -2 \\) into each part:\n\n1. \\( n + 3 \\) becomes \\( -2 + 3 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( n^2 + 9 \\) becomes \\( (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 \\)\n3. The coefficient 3 remains 3.\n\nSo, multiplying these together:\n\\[\n3 \\times 1 \\times 13 = 39\n\\]\nTherefore, \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\equiv 39 \\mod (n + 2) \\)\n\nBut since \\( n + 2 \\) divides the original expression, this congruence must be congruent to 0 modulo \\( n + 2 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n39 \\equiv 0 \\mod (n + 2)\n\\]\nWhich implies that \\( n + 2 \\) is a positive divisor of 39.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! So, \\( n + 2 \\) must divide 39. Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( n + 2 \\) must be at least 3 (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)). \n\nNow, let's list all positive divisors of 39. The prime factorization of 39 is \\( 3 \\times 13 \\), so the positive divisors are:\n1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut since \\( n + 2 \\geq 3 \\), we can exclude 1. Therefore, the possible values of \\( n + 2 \\) are 3, 13, 39. \n\nThus, solving for \\( n \\):\n- If \\( n + 2 = 3 \\), then \\( n = 1 \\)\n- If \\( n + 2 = 13 \\), then \\( n = 11 \\)\n- If \\( n + 2 = 39 \\), then \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nSo the positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, and 37. \n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check these solutions to make sure they actually work. Sometimes, even if the modulus approach suggests a solution, there might be cases where the substitution leads to an extraneous solution, especially if there are multiple factors or if the modulus isn't prime. Let me verify each one.\n\nFirst, \\( n = 1 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 10 = 120 \\)\nNow divide by \\( n + 2 = 3 \\): \\( 120 \u00f7 3 = 40 \\), which is an integer. So, works.\n\nNext, \\( n = 11 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times (121 + 9) = 3 \\times 14 \\times 130 \\)\nCalculate step by step: 14 \u00d7 130 = 1820; 3 \u00d7 1820 = 5460\nDivide by \\( n + 2 = 13 \\): 5460 \u00f7 13 = 420, which is an integer. So, works.\n\nThen, \\( n = 39 \\), wait, no, \\( n = 37 \\):\nCompute \\( 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) \\)\nFirst, \\( 37 + 3 = 40 \\), \\( 37^2 = 1369 \\), so \\( 1369 + 9 = 1378 \\)\nMultiply: 3 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 1378\nFirst, 3 \u00d7 40 = 120; 120 \u00d7 1378\nLet me compute 1378 \u00d7 100 = 137,800; 1378 \u00d7 20 = 27,560\nAdd them: 137,800 + 27,560 = 165,360\nNow, divide by \\( n + 2 = 39 \\): 165,360 \u00f7 39\nCalculate 39 \u00d7 4,000 = 156,000. Subtract: 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360\nNow, 39 \u00d7 240 = 9,360. So total is 4,000 + 240 = 4,240. Which is an integer. So, yes, works.\n\nTherefore, all three values are valid. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. When we did the substitution \\( n \u2261 -2 \\mod (n + 2) \\), is there a possibility that we missed any divisors? Because when we set \\( 39 \u2261 0 \\mod (n + 2) \\), we concluded that \\( n + 2 \\) divides 39. But 39 is positive, so all its positive divisors are considered, and since \\( n + 2 \\geq 3 \\), we only took 3, 13, 39. \n\nBut could there be negative divisors? Well, since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( n + 2 \\) must also be positive, so negative divisors of 39 (which are -1, -3, -13, -39) are irrelevant here. So, we didn't miss anything there.\n\nAlternatively, is there another approach to confirm that these are the only solutions? Let's try using polynomial division or factorization.\n\nWe can express \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\) divided by \\( n + 2 \\). Let's perform the division to see if there's a remainder, and set the remainder to zero.\n\nAlternatively, write \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = (n + 2)Q(n) + R \\), where R is the remainder when dividing by \\( n + 2 \\). As we did earlier, substituting \\( n = -2 \\) gives R = 39. Therefore, for \\( n + 2 \\) to divide the expression, 39 must be divisible by \\( n + 2 \\). So, indeed, the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, our solutions are correct. \n\nSo, the positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, 37. The sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nWait, 1 + 11 is 12, 12 + 37 is 49. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 49. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other divisors of 39 that I might have missed. Wait, 39 is 3 \u00d7 13, so divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. That's all. So, no, we considered all. So, the three values of \\( n + 2 \\) are 3,13,39, leading to n=1,11,37. \n\nYes, that's all. Therefore, the sum is 49. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "Okay, so I need to find the sum of all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Hmm, let's start by understanding what this means. The problem is essentially saying that when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2), there should be no remainder. So, (n + 2) must be a divisor of that product. \n\nFirst, maybe I can rewrite the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) in terms of (n + 2). Let me see. Let's denote k = n + 2. Then, n = k - 2. Substituting this into the product might help. Let's try that.\n\nIf n = k - 2, then:\n\nn + 3 = (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1\n\nn\u00b2 + 9 = (k - 2)\u00b2 + 9 = k\u00b2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k\u00b2 - 4k + 13\n\nSo, the product becomes 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). Therefore, the original condition is that k divides this product. Since k = n + 2, and n is a positive integer, k must be an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n is positive, k = n + 2 \u2265 1 + 2 = 3). \n\nSo, we need to find all integers k \u2265 3 such that k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). Then, once we find such k, we can subtract 2 to get n and sum them up. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Divisibility conditions often involve modular arithmetic. So, perhaps we can write the product as a multiple of k. That is, 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 mod k. \n\nSimplifying this expression modulo k. Let's compute each part modulo k:\n\nFirst, (k + 1) \u2261 1 mod k, since k \u2261 0 mod k, so k + 1 \u2261 1 mod k.\n\nSimilarly, k\u00b2 - 4k + 13: Let's compute this modulo k. Each term:\n\nk\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod k,\n\n-4k \u2261 0 mod k,\n\n13 \u2261 13 mod k.\n\nTherefore, k\u00b2 - 4k + 13 \u2261 13 mod k.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 3 * 1 * 13 \u2261 39 mod k.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that 39 \u2261 0 mod k. Which means that k divides 39. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! So, k must be a positive divisor of 39. Since k \u2265 3, we need to list all divisors of 39 that are at least 3. \n\nFirst, let's factorize 39. 39 = 3 * 13. Therefore, the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, and 39. But since k \u2265 3, the possible values of k are 3, 13, and 39. \n\nTherefore, the corresponding n values are k - 2:\n\nFor k = 3: n = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nFor k = 13: n = 13 - 2 = 11\n\nFor k = 39: n = 39 - 2 = 37\n\nSo, the positive integers n are 1, 11, and 37. Then, their sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nWait a second, but let me verify this. Because sometimes when substituting variables, especially when dealing with divisibility, there might be cases where even though k divides 39, the original expression might not hold due to some oversight. Let me check each n to ensure they actually satisfy the condition.\n\nFirst, n = 1:\n\nCheck if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So, yes, 3 divides 120. Good.\n\nNext, n = 11:\n\n11 + 2 = 13. Check if 13 divides 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let's compute that:\n\n3*14 = 42, then 42*130 = 5460. Now, 5460 divided by 13: 13*420 = 5460. So, 5460 /13 = 420, which is an integer. So, 13 divides 5460. Correct.\n\nNext, n = 37:\n\n37 + 2 = 39. Check if 39 divides 3(37 + 3)(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let's compute:\n\n3*40 = 120, then 120*1378. Let's compute 120*1378. 1378*100 = 137800, 1378*20 = 27560. So total is 137800 + 27560 = 165,360. Now, divide 165,360 by 39. Let's see: 39*4000 = 156,000. Subtract that from 165,360: 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360. Now, 39*240 = 9,360. So, total is 4000 + 240 = 4240. Therefore, 39*4240 = 165,360. Hence, 39 divides 165,360. Correct.\n\nSo, all three n values work. Therefore, the sum is indeed 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me think again. The key step was when we substituted k = n + 2 and reduced the expression modulo k. Let me re-examine that step to ensure there were no mistakes. \n\nWe had to compute 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k. \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n(k + 1) mod k = 1, correct. \n\n(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k: k\u00b2 mod k = 0, -4k mod k = 0, so 13 mod k. So yes, the entire expression becomes 3 * 1 * 13 mod k = 39 mod k. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod k \u21d2 k divides 39. \n\nTherefore, k must be a positive divisor of 39. Since k = n + 2 and n is positive, k must be at least 3. The divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. Excluding 1, we get k = 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. \n\nThis seems solid. But perhaps there's another approach to confirm? Let's try polynomial division or factorization.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the original divisibility condition as:\n\n(n + 2) divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nWe can express this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = q(n + 2), where q is some integer. \n\nAlternatively, perform polynomial division of 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2) and see what the remainder is. If the remainder is zero, then it's divisible.\n\nBut polynomial division might be tedious, but perhaps synthetic division can help. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, use the Remainder Theorem. The remainder when a polynomial f(n) is divided by (n + 2) is f(-2). Let's compute f(-2) where f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nCompute f(-2):\n\n3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 39. So, for (n + 2) to divide f(n), the remainder must be zero. Therefore, 39 must be congruent to 0 mod (n + 2). Hence, (n + 2) divides 39. So, n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39, which is the same conclusion as before. Therefore, n + 2 \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39}, but since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3, so n + 2 \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, leading to n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}. \n\nSo, this confirms the same result. Therefore, the answer is 49. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other possible n that might have been missed. For example, if k is a divisor of 39 but negative? But since n is a positive integer, k = n + 2 must be at least 3, so negative divisors are irrelevant here. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a case where even though k doesn't divide 39, the product still divides? But according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder is 39, so unless 39 is zero mod k, which requires k divides 39, there's no other possibility. Therefore, the only possible k are the divisors of 39. Hence, the solution set is indeed {1, 11, 37}. \n\nTherefore, the sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any gaps in the reasoning. Both substitution and the Remainder Theorem approach lead to the same conclusion. Plus, manually checking each n value confirmed they work. So, the final answer is 49.\n",
        "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). Hmm, divisibility condition. Let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's write down the condition mathematically. We need \\( n + 2 \\) to divide \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). In other words, when we divide \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\) by \\( n + 2 \\), there should be no remainder. So, \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\equiv 0 \\mod (n + 2) \\).\n\nTo solve this, maybe I can use the Remainder Theorem. If I consider the polynomial \\( P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\), then when we divide \\( P(n) \\) by \\( n + 2 \\), the remainder is \\( P(-2) \\). Since \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( P(n) \\), the remainder must be zero. Therefore, \\( P(-2) = 0 \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( P(-2) \\):\n\n\\( P(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 \\).\n\nWait, so the remainder is 39. But for \\( n + 2 \\) to divide \\( P(n) \\), we need the remainder to be zero. However, according to this, the remainder is 39. That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nHold on, perhaps the Remainder Theorem applies here, but we have to consider that \\( n \\) is a variable, and we're looking for specific integer values of \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product. So, the Remainder Theorem tells us that \\( P(n) \\equiv P(-2) \\mod (n + 2) \\). Therefore, \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\equiv 39 \\mod (n + 2) \\). For \\( n + 2 \\) to divide \\( P(n) \\), this implies that \\( 39 \\equiv 0 \\mod (n + 2) \\). Therefore, \\( n + 2 \\) must be a divisor of 39.\n\nAh, that makes sense! So, \\( n + 2 \\) divides 39. Therefore, \\( n + 2 \\) is a positive integer divisor of 39. Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( n + 2 \\) must be at least 3 (since \\( n \\geq 1 \\) implies \\( n + 2 \\geq 3 \\)). Let's list all positive divisors of 39.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are: 1, 3, 13, 39. But since \\( n + 2 \\geq 3 \\), the possible values of \\( n + 2 \\) are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, the corresponding \\( n \\) values are:\n\n- If \\( n + 2 = 3 \\), then \\( n = 1 \\)\n- If \\( n + 2 = 13 \\), then \\( n = 11 \\)\n- If \\( n + 2 = 39 \\), then \\( n = 37 \\)\n\nSo, the possible positive integers \\( n \\) are 1, 11, 37. Let's check each of these to make sure they satisfy the original condition.\n\nFirst, \\( n = 1 \\):\n\nCompute \\( n + 2 = 3 \\). The product is \\( 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 * 4 * 10 = 120 \\). Check if 3 divides 120. Yes, 120 \u00f7 3 = 40. So, that works.\n\nNext, \\( n = 11 \\):\n\nCompute \\( n + 2 = 13 \\). The product is \\( 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3 * 14 * (121 + 9) = 3 * 14 * 130 \\). Let's compute that: 3*14=42, then 42*130=5460. Now, check if 13 divides 5460. Since 13*420=5460, yes. So, that works.\n\nThird, \\( n = 37 \\):\n\nCompute \\( n + 2 = 39 \\). The product is \\( 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) = 3 * 40 * (1369 + 9) = 3 * 40 * 1378 \\). Let's compute step by step: 3*40=120, then 120*1378. Hmm, 120*1378. Let's see: 100*1378=137,800; 20*1378=27,560; sum them: 137,800 + 27,560 = 165,360. Now, check if 39 divides 165,360. Let's divide 165,360 by 39. 39*4000=156,000. Subtract: 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360. 39*240=9,360. So total is 4000 + 240 = 4,240. So, 39*4,240=165,360. Therefore, yes, it divides exactly. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, the valid \\( n \\) are 1, 11, 37. The sum of these is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. So, the answer should be 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other divisors of 39 that I missed. The divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. We considered 3, 13, 39. The divisor 1 would correspond to \\( n + 2 = 1 \\), so \\( n = -1 \\), but since \\( n \\) must be positive, we discard that. So, yes, only 3,13,39 are valid. Therefore, the sum is indeed 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using modular arithmetic or polynomial division. Let me try polynomial division to see if I can express \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\) divided by \\( n + 2 \\).\n\nFirst, expand \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( (n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\):\n\n\\( n(n^2 + 9) + 3(n^2 + 9) = n^3 + 9n + 3n^2 + 27 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 9n + 27 \\).\n\nThen multiply by 3:\n\n\\( 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 \\).\n\nNow, divide this by \\( n + 2 \\). Let's perform polynomial long division.\n\nDivide \\( 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81 \\) by \\( n + 2 \\).\n\nFirst term: \\( 3n^3 \u00f7 n = 3n^2 \\). Multiply \\( 3n^2 \\) by \\( n + 2 \\): \\( 3n^3 + 6n^2 \\). Subtract from the original polynomial:\n\n\\( (3n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 81) - (3n^3 + 6n^2) = 3n^2 + 27n + 81 \\).\n\nNext term: \\( 3n^2 \u00f7 n = 3n \\). Multiply \\( 3n \\) by \\( n + 2 \\): \\( 3n^2 + 6n \\). Subtract:\n\n\\( (3n^2 + 27n + 81) - (3n^2 + 6n) = 21n + 81 \\).\n\nNext term: \\( 21n \u00f7 n = 21 \\). Multiply 21 by \\( n + 2 \\): \\( 21n + 42 \\). Subtract:\n\n\\( (21n + 81) - (21n + 42) = 39 \\).\n\nSo, the division gives quotient \\( 3n^2 + 3n + 21 \\) with a remainder of 39. Therefore, \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = (n + 2)(3n^2 + 3n + 21) + 39 \\).\n\nTherefore, for \\( n + 2 \\) to divide the product, the remainder must be zero, so 39 must be divisible by \\( n + 2 \\). Which brings us back to the same conclusion: \\( n + 2 \\) divides 39. So, same result as before. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nHence, the sum is 49. So, I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's any other possible divisor that I might have missed. For example, if 39 had negative divisors, but since n is positive, n + 2 must be positive. So, only positive divisors. So, yes, only 3, 13, 39. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, we need to sum all such n. Hmm, divisibility condition here. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the condition given is that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In mathematical terms, this means that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is a multiple of n + 2. So, we can write this as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nWhich implies that when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there's no remainder. To find the values of n that satisfy this, maybe I can use polynomial division or some modular arithmetic properties.\n\nLet me recall that if we have a polynomial P(x), then P(a) \u2261 0 mod (x - a). Wait, here our modulus is n + 2, which is like x = -2. So maybe substituting n = -2 into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) will give the remainder when divided by n + 2.\n\nYes, the Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of dividing a polynomial P(n) by (n - a) is P(a). But here, we have (n + 2) which is equivalent to (n - (-2)). So, substituting n = -2 into the polynomial 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) should give the remainder.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nP(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)\n\nThen, P(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3 * 1 * 13 = 39\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divided by (n + 2) is 39. So, for n + 2 to divide the product, 39 must be divisible by n + 2. In other words, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39.\n\nSince n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1 implies n + 2 \u2265 3). But the divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. However, since n + 2 must be greater than or equal to 3, the possible divisors are 3, 13, 39.\n\nTherefore, n + 2 \u2208 {3, 13, 39}, which leads to n \u2208 {1, 11, 37}.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this. The remainder is 39, so n + 2 divides 39. So yes, the positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But n must be positive, so n + 2 can't be 1, because n would be -1, which is not positive. Therefore, the possible n + 2 values are 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut let me check each of these n values to ensure they actually satisfy the original condition. Sometimes, even if the remainder is zero, there might be a mistake in the calculation.\n\nFirst, n = 1:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120\n\nn + 2 = 3. Check if 3 divides 120. 120 \u00f7 3 = 40. Yes, no remainder. Good.\n\nn = 11:\n\nCompute 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130\n\nCalculate that: 3*14 = 42; 42*130 = 5460\n\nn + 2 = 13. Check if 13 divides 5460. 5460 \u00f7 13. Let's compute 13*420 = 5460. Yes, exactly. So 13 divides 5460. Good.\n\nn = 37:\n\nCompute 3(37 + 3)(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378\n\nCalculate that: 3*40 = 120; 120*1378. Let's compute 1378*100 = 137800; 1378*20 = 27560; total is 137800 + 27560 = 165,360.\n\nn + 2 = 39. Check if 39 divides 165,360. 39*4240 = 165,360 (since 39*4000=156,000; 39*240=9,360; total 156,000+9,360=165,360). So yes, 39 divides 165,360. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the valid n values are 1, 11, 37. Their sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure there aren't any other divisors of 39 that I missed. 39 factors into 3*13, so its positive divisors are indeed 1, 3, 13, 39. So n + 2 can only be 3,13,39 as n is positive. Hence, those are the only possibilities. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"positive integers n\", so n must be in natural numbers. So n + 2 can be 3,13,39 leading to n=1,11,37. So sum is 1+11+37=49. That's the conclusion.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe through algebraic manipulation, to confirm.\n\nWe have that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let me try to express 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) in terms of (n + 2). Maybe perform polynomial division.\n\nLet me set m = n + 2. Then, n = m - 2. Substitute into the expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((m - 2) + 3)((m - 2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +4 +9) = 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13)\n\nSo, we have 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13). We need to check when m divides this expression. Since m is a divisor of 39, as established before, but let's see if this approach gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of m and 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13). But since m divides 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13), m must divide the constant term when the expression is written as a polynomial in m. Wait, maybe expanding the expression would help.\n\nWait, expanding 3(m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13):\n\nFirst, multiply (m + 1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13):\n\n= m*(m\u00b2 -4m +13) + 1*(m\u00b2 -4m +13)\n\n= m\u00b3 -4m\u00b2 +13m + m\u00b2 -4m +13\n\n= m\u00b3 -3m\u00b2 +9m +13\n\nThen multiply by 3:\n\n= 3m\u00b3 -9m\u00b2 +27m +39\n\nSo, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) expressed in terms of m is 3m\u00b3 -9m\u00b2 +27m +39.\n\nWe need m divides this polynomial. So, 3m\u00b3 -9m\u00b2 +27m +39 \u2261 0 mod m.\n\nBut modulo m, 3m\u00b3 \u2261 0, -9m\u00b2 \u2261 0, 27m \u2261 0, so the entire expression \u2261 39 mod m. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod m, which means m divides 39. So, same result as before. Therefore, m is a positive divisor of 39, leading to n = m -2, where m \u2208 {3,13,39}, so n \u2208 {1,11,37}. So, same answer.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 49. Seems solid.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let's check n = 1, 11, 37 again with substitution.\n\nn =1:\n\nn +2 =3. Compute 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) =3*4*10=120. 120 \u00f73=40. Yes.\n\nn=11:\n\nn +2=13. Compute 3*14*(121+9)=3*14*130=5460. 5460 \u00f713=420. Correct.\n\nn=37:\n\nn +2=39. Compute 3*40*(1369+9)=3*40*1378=165,360. 165,360 \u00f739=4240. Correct.\n\nAll check out. So, the answer is 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nI think that's all. There's no other divisors of 39, so those are the only solutions. Hence, the sum is 49.\n"

So d | 39?\n\nBut d = n+2, and n is positive integer, so d >= 3.\n\nAnd 39 is a constant, so its divisors are the positive divisors of 39.\n\n39 factors: 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut d >= 3, so d=3,13,39.\n\nIs that all? But let me check.\n\nAccording to this, for d to divide the expression, d must divide 39, since the expression is congruent to 39 mod d, and must be 0 mod d.\n\nBut is this sufficient? Let me verify with actual values.\n\nFirst, d=3, so n+2=3, n=1.\n\nCompute the expression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(1+3)(1+9) = 3*4*10=120\n\nn+2=3, and 3 divides 120? 120/3=40, yes.\n\nNext, d=13, n=11.\n\nExpression: 3(11+3)(11^2 +9) = 3*14*(121+9)=3*14*130\n\n11^2=121, plus 9 is 130, yes.\n\n3*14=42, 42*130.\n\n40*130=5200, 2*130=260, total 5460.\n\nn+2=13, 5460 / 13.\n\n13*420=5460? 13*400=5200, 13*20=260, total 5460, yes.\n\nNow d=39, n=37.\n\nExpression: 3(37+3)(37^2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=120*1378\n\n37^2=1369? 30^2=900, 7^2=49, 2*30*7=420, so 900+420+49=1369, yes. Plus 9 is 1378.\n\nSo 120*1378.\n\nFirst, 100*1378=137800, 20*1378=27560, total 137800+27560=165360.\n\nNow n+2=39, divide 165360 by 39.\n\n39*4000=156000, subtract 165360-156000=9360.\n\n39*240=39*200=7800, 39*40=1560, total 7800+1560=9360.\n\nSo 4000+240=4240, yes, exactly 39*4240=165360? 39*4000=156000, 39*240=9360, total 156000+9360=165360, yes.\n\nSo works.\n\nBut the problem is to sum all such n, and I have n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut are there more? Earlier I listed d=3,13,39, but what about d=1? d=n+2, n positive integer, so d>=3, since n>=1, so d=1 is not possible. But what about negative divisors? Since n is positive integer, n+2 is at least 3, so positive. But divisors could be negative, but since we're dealing with divisibility in integers, negative divisors might also work, but typically for positive integers, we consider positive divisors, but let me confirm.\n\nIn the congruence, when we say d divides a, d can be negative, but since n+2 is positive for n positive integer, we can assume d>0, so divisors are positive.\n\nBut let me think: for example, if d=-1, but d=n+2>=3>0, so not possible.\n\nBut in the divisor list, 39 has negative divisors, but corresponds to negative d, which would give negative n, but n is positive integer, so we only consider positive d.\n\nBut earlier I only have three values: 1,11,37 sum to 49.\n\nBut the problem says \"sum of all positive integers\", and I have three, but let me see if there are more.\n\nWhen I reduced modulo d, I got that the expression is congruent to 39 mod d, and for that to be 0, d must divide 39.\n\nBut is this sufficient? In my calculation above, it worked for those three, but is it necessary and sufficient?\n\nI recall that when I substituted, and modulo d, the expression simplifies to 39, so yes, it's congruent to 39 mod d, and for d to divide it, it must divide 39.\n\nBut in the product, when I wrote it as 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13), and d divides this, so since d divides d, but in modular arithmetic, we showed that it's equivalent to d|39.\n\nBut let me see why this works. Because when we expand the expression, it might have terms with d, but in this case, since we evaluated mod d and got constant 39, which is independent of d, so yes, for d to divide it, d must divide 39.\n\nBut is there a possibility that for some d, the expression is divisible by d, but d does not divide 39? For example, if d divides one of the factors, but in this case, modulo d, d+1 \u22611 and d^2-4d+13\u226113, neither is zero unless d|1 or d|13, but anyway, the product is 39 only if none are zero, but if d divides, say, d+1, but d+1 \u22611 \u22600 mod d, so d+1 is not divisible by d, since d and d+1 coprime.\n\nSimilarly, d^2-4d+13 \u226113 \u22600 mod d unless d|13.\n\nSo in all cases, the expression modulo d is exactly 39, as long as d doesn't divide 1 or 13 or something, but no, because we assumed nothing; modulo d, it's always 39, regardless.\n\nTo confirm, suppose d does not divide 39, say d=5.\n\nThen n=3, expression: 3(3+3)(9+9)=3*6*18=324? n+2=5, 324 /5 =64.8, not integer, and 324 mod 5=4, not 0, and 39 mod 5=4, same.\n\nd=7, n=5, expression 3(5+3)(25+9)=3*8*34=24*34=816, n+2=7, 816 /7 \u2248116.571, 7*116=812, 816-812=4, so remainder 4, 39 mod 7=4, yes.\n\nNow, what about if d divides one of the factors? For example, if d|3, but d|3, then d=1 or 3, but d>=3, so d=3, which we have.\n\nBut when d=3, modulo d, d+1=4\u22611, not 0, d^2-4d+13=9-12+13=10\u22611? 9-12 is -3, +13=10, 10 mod 3 is 1? 10-9=1, yes.\n\nExpression 39 mod 3=0, since 39/3=13.\n\nIn that case, it is 0, but still congruent to 39, but 39\u22610 mod 3.\n\nSimilarly, if d|13, say d=13, 39\u22610 mod 13 since 13*3=39.\n\nBut are there cases where the expression is divisible by d, but 39 is not congruent to 0 mod d? For example, suppose d divides the product because it divides one of the factors.\n\nFor instance, if d+1 \u22610 mod d, but d+1 \u22611 \u22600 mod d, always, since d\u22653>0.\n\nd+1 is never divisible by d for integer d \u22600.\n\nSimilarly, could d divide d^2 -4d +13? Well, that would require that d | 13, as we saw modulo d it's 13.\n\nCould d divide 3? But if d|3, then as above.\n\nSuppose d is such that the product is divisible by d even if d doesn't divide 39. Is that possible? According to the congruence, no, because the expression is always congruent to 39 mod d, so if d does not divide 39, expression not divisible by d.\n\nMoreover, if d divides 39, then since expression \u226139\u22610 mod d, so it is divisible.\n\nSo it should be necessary and sufficient.\n\nBut is that true when d divides 39? We already checked for d=3,13,39, all work.\n\nBut what about d=1? But d=n+2\u22653, so excluded.\n\nd=39 is included, n=37.\n\nBut 39 has divisor 1,3,13,39, all positive.\n\nBut 39 also has negative divisors, but as said, d>0.\n\nBut let me check d=39, we did.\n\nBut earlier I thought only these, but 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, but d>=3, so three of them.\n\nBut is there d=1? n=-1, not positive.\n\nd= -1, n=-3, not positive.\n\nBut what about when d divides the expression, but in our case, since expression is integer, and d divides it iff d|39.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if d is a divisor that makes one of the factors undefined or something, but no.\n\nAnother thing: in the expression, when we substituted, we assumed d is integer, which it is, since n integer.\n\nBut in the modulo operation, it's fine.\n\nNotice that for d=1, but not allowed.\n\nBut in our derivation, we have expression \u226139 mod d, so for d to divide the expression, it must divide 39.\n\nBut actually, strictly speaking, the expression is equal to 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13), and d divides this quantity.\n\nNow, this quantity minus 39 is divisible by d? Let me compute exactly.\n\nSet f(d) = 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)\n\nExpand this.\n\nFirst, (d+1)(d^2-4d+13) = d(d^2-4d+13) +1*(d^2-4d+13) = d^3 -4d^2 +13d + d^2 -4d +13 = d^3 -3d^2 +9d +13\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nNow, we have f(d) = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nNow, we want d to divide f(d), that is, f(d) \u22610 mod d.\n\nBut modulo d, as before, f(d) \u2261 39 mod d, since the other terms have d.\n\nExplicitly, f(d) - 39 = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d = d(3d^2 -9d +27)\n\nSo f(d) = d(3d^2 -9d +27) + 39\n\nTherefore, f(d) \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}, but since d is the modulus, yes.\n\nFor d to divide f(d), since f(d) = d \\cdot q(d) + 39, where q(d) is that polynomial, then f(d) \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}, and for this to be 0, we need 39 \u22610 mod d, i.e., d|39.\n\nMoreover, when d|39, since f(d) is exactly 39 plus a multiple of d, so if d|39, then d divides the entire f(d).\n\nSo yes, necessary and sufficient condition is that d divides 39.\n\nTherefore, d | 39, and d = n+2 \u2265 3.\n\nDivisors of 39 are positive divisors: 1,3,13,39.\n\nd\u22653, so d=3,13,39, giving n=1,11,37.\n\nSum: 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nSo the sum is 49.\n\nThe problem says \"positive integers\", and I have three, sum to 49.\n\nBut let me see if n=0 is considered, but n positive integer, so n\u22651.\n\nIf n=0, d=2, expression 3(3)(0+9)=3*3*9=81, n+2=2, 81 not divisible by 2? 81 odd, no. And d=2 not divisor of 39.\n\nBut anyway, not positive.\n\nBut is there any other divisor? What about when d divides the polynomial part, but no.\n\nAnother thing: in the expression, when d divides 39, but also if d is large, but no, only divisors.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that for each divisor, but only these.\n\nBut let me check if d=39, we did, worked.\n\nBut just to be sure, is there a possibility that for some n, even if d does not divide 39, but the expression might still be divisible? But according to the formula, f(d) -39 is divisible by d, so if d does not divide 39, remainder is 39 not divisible by d, so no.\n\nSuppose d divides q(d), but q(d) is part of it, but in the equality f(d) = d * q(d) + 39, so unless q(d) is integer, which it is, but still, f(d) \u226139 mod d, so only if d|39.\n\nSo I think it's complete.\n\nBut let me think again: in the beginning, when I set d=n+2, and got that expression is congruent to 39 mod d, and thus d must divide 39.\n\nBut is this always true? For example, if d=0, but d\u22600 since n\u22651.\n\nOr if denominator is zero, but no.\n\nAnother way to look at it: since n\u2261-2 mod (n+2), so plug into the expression.\n\nSo expression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nSet n\u2261-2 mod d, with d=n+2.\n\nThen n+3 \u22611\n\nn^2+9 \u2261 (-2)^2 +9=4+9=13\n\nSo 3*1*13=39, same as before.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that for some n, n+2 might divide the expression even if it doesn't divide 39, but as above, it shouldn't.\n\nMaybe when n+2 is negative, but n positive, so no.\n\nOr if n is such that the divisor is smaller, but no.\n\nI could perform polynomial division or something, but I think it's unnecessary.\n\nSince n+2 divides the expression, and the expression is a cubic, I could write the expression divided by n+2.\n\nBut from earlier, we have f(d) = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nBut this is in terms of d=n+2, so in terms of n.\n\nSince we have f(d) = d(3d^2 -9d +27) +39\n\nSo when divided by d, the quotient is 3d^2 -9d +27, and remainder 39.\n\nTherefore, for d to divide f(d), d must divide 39.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no other possibilities.\n\nThus only n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nSo answer should be 49.\n\nBut let me double-check with another divisor. Say, d=1, n=-1, but not positive.\n\nd=39, we did.\n\nd=13, did.\n\nd=3, did.\n\nIs 1 a divisor? but n not positive.\n\nOr d=39, but what about d=13? all done.\n\n39 has positive divisors only these four, but d\u22653 excludes only 1.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there d= -3? But d=n+2>0, no.\n\nSuppose n+2=39, covered.\n\nPerhaps I missed some factor, but 39=3*13, so divisors are \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139, positive are 1,3,13,39, n+2\u22653 gives three.\n\nBut let me check n corresponding.\n\nd=1, n=-1 not positive.\n\nd=3,n=1\n\nd=13,n=11\n\nd=39,n=37\n\nAll work as computed.\n\nSum 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I get 49.\n\nBut I recall that sometimes there might be more solutions if the divisor shares common factors, but in this case, no, because the condition is exact.\n\nAnother way: perhaps when n+2 divides the remainder only if coprime or something, but no.\n\nSet m=n+2, so we want m | 3(n+3)(n^2+9) with n=m-2.\n\nThen as before, 3(m+1)((m-2)^2 +9) = 3(m+1)(m^2 -4m +4+9)=3(m+1)(m^2-4m+13)\n\nNow, this must be divisible by m, so 3(m+1)(m^2-4m+13) \u2261 0 mod m.\n\nSince m and m+1 are coprime, and m^2-4m+13 mod m is 13, so unless m divides 3 or something, but generally, since m+1 \u22611 mod m, not zero, so the only restriction is that m divides 3*1*13=39, same as before.\n\nMore formally, since m and m+1 are coprime, m must divide 3(m^2-4m+13), but then modulo m, it reduces to m | 3*13=39, same thing.\n\nBecause m^2-4m+13 \u226113 mod m.\n\nSo no mistake.\n\nTherefore, sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut let me compute the sum: 1+11=12, 37+12=49.\n\nOr 1+37=38, 38+11=49.\n\nYes.\n\nSo answer should be 49.\n\nBut the problem is from maybe a competition, perhaps I missed some solutions.\n\nAnother thought: what if m divides the expression and m is a divisor, but perhaps when m divides one of the coefficients, but in this case, no.\n\nFor example, if m=39, it works, but is there n where n+2 is larger but still divides? But no, because if m>39, and doesn't divide 39, then remainder non-zero.\n\nFor example, m=40, n=38.\n\nExpression: 3(38+3)(38^2 +9)=3*41*(1444+9)=3*41*1453\n\n38^2=1444, yes, +9=1453.\n\nNow n+2=40.\n\nDoes 40 divide 3*41*1453?\n\nFirst, 40=8*5, so need divisible by 8 and 5.\n\nCheck mod 5: 3*41*1453 mod 5.\n\n3 mod 5=3\n\n41\u00f75=8*5=40, remainder 1\n\n1453\u00f75: 1450=290*5, 1453-1450=3, so remainder 3.\n\nSo 3*1*3=9\u22614 \u22600 mod 5, so no.\n\nAnd 39 mod 40=39\u22600.\n\nAnother example, m=26, not divisor, n=24.\n\nExpression: 3(24+3)(576+9)=3*27*585\n\n27*3=81, 81*585.\n\nn+2=26.\n\n585\u00f726? 26*22=572, 585-572=13, not zero.\n\nBut 39 mod 26=39-26=13\u22600.\n\nNow, what if m=13, worked.\n\nBut is there another divisor? 39 and 13.\n\nBut 39 has only these.\n\nPerhaps I should list all divisors: 39 factors: \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139.\n\nPositive:1,3,13,39.\n\nn positive, so m\u22653, so m=3,13,39, n=1,11,37.\n\nSum 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nOr perhaps they want sum including if n+2 divides, but same.\n\nAnother thing: could n+2 be equal to a divisor when the expression is zero, but expression is 3(n+3)(n^2+9), n^2+9\u22659>0, n+3\u22654>0, so expression always positive for n\u22651, no zeros.\n\nPerhaps if n+2 is negative, but not for positive n.\n\nSuppose n= -1, then d=1, expression 3(2)(1+9)=3*2*10=60, divisible by 1, yes, but n not positive.\n\nSimilarly, n= -3, d= -1? n+2= -1.\n\nExpression 3(0)(9+9)=0, and -1 divides 0? Well, yes, but n not positive.\n\nn= -4, d= -2.\n\nExpression 3(-4+3)(16+9)=3(-1)(25)= -75\n\nn+2= -2, -75 / (-2) = 37.5, not integer. 39 mod (-2): but in integers, divisibility by negative is same as by absolute value, since -2 divides if 2 divides.\n\n-75 div by -2: since -75 / -2 = 75/2=37.5 not integer, so no.\n\nBut anyway, not positive n.\n\nSo only the three positive n.\n\nBut sum is 49, but let me confirm calculations:\n\nn=1: expression 3(4)(1+9)=3*4*10=120, n+2=3, 120/3=40, yes.\n\nn=11: 3(14)(121+9)=3*14*130=42*130=5460, n+2=13, 13*420=5460, since 13*400=5200,13*20=260, total 5460, yes.\n\nn=37: 3(40)(37^2 +9)=120*(1369+9)=120*1378.\n\n1378*100=137800, 1378*20=27560, total 137800+27560=165360.\n\nn+2=39, 39*4240= as before, 39*4000=156000, 39*240=9360, total 156000+9360=165360, yes.\n\nSum: 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\n1+37=38,38+11=49.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that for n=3, we saw it doesn't work.\n\nOr n=0, but not positive.\n\nMaybe n such that n+2 divides, but perhaps n+2 could be a divisor of the remainder, but no.\n\nAnother way: since we have f(d) = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39, and set this equal to k d for some integer k, but since we have the polynomial, and for integer d, but we solved when d|39.\n\nWe can solve f(d) is divisible by d, so f(d) \u22610 mod d, leading to d|39.\n\nSet the equation: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) / (n+2) is integer.\n\nSo perform polynomial division of 3(n+3)(n^2+9) by n+2.\n\nSince we have it in terms of d, same.\n\nCompute the quotient.\n\nSet the expression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) divided by n+2.\n\nFirst, note that (n+3)/(n+2) is not polynomial, but we can write.\n\nSince n\u2261 -2 mod (n+2), but we already did.\n\nCompute the ratio: \\frac{3(n+3)(n^2+9)}{n+2}\n\nNote that n^2 +9 = (n^2 -4) +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13? n^2 -4 = (n-2)(n+2), yes.\n\nn^2 +9 = n^2 -4 +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13.\n\nSo, \\frac{3(n+3)[(n-2)(n+2) +13]}{n+2} = 3(n+3)\\left( n-2 + \\frac{13}{n+2} \\right) = 3(n+3)(n-2) + \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2}\n\nNow, for this to be integer, since the first term is polynomial hence integer, so we need \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2} to be integer.\n\nSet m = n+2, as before, then \\frac{39(m +1)}{m} = 39 + \\frac{39}{m}\n\nSo \\frac{39}{m} must be integer, since 39 is integer.\n\nThus m must divide 39.\n\nSame conclusion.\n\nTherefore, m | 39, m\u22653, so m=3,13,39, n=1,11,37, sum 49.\n\nNotice that in the expression \\frac{39(n+3)}{n+2}, which is 39(1 + \\frac{1}{n+2}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{n+2}, so indeed integer iff n+2 divides 39.\n\nSo confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nSo the answer should be 49.\n\nBut let me list the n: 1,11,37.\n\nPositive integers, all good.\n\nSum is 49.\n\nPerhaps they include n such that n+2 negative, but no, since positive n.\n\nMaybe n=0, but n=0, expression 3(3)(0+9)=81, n+2=2, 81 not divisible by 2.\n\nOr n=-1, but not positive.\n\nSo I think that's all.\n\nThus the sum is 49.\n",
        "I need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). In mathematical terms, this means that:\n\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n+2} \\]\n\nSince \\( n+2 \\) is the divisor, I can use the property that if \\( d \\) divides \\( a \\), and \\( d = n+2 \\), then \\( a \\) is congruent to 0 modulo d. But here, the expression is in terms of n, so I should express everything in terms of \\( n+2 \\).\n\nSet \\( d = n+2 \\). Then, \\( n = d - 2 \\).\n\nNow, substitute this into the product:\n\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d+1)((d^2 - 4d + 4) + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nSo, the product is \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), and since \\( d = n+2 \\), and d divides this product, we have:\n\n\\[ d \\mid 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\]\n\nBecause d divides this expression, and d divides d, obviously, so in particular, d must divide the entire expression. Since d divides any multiple of d, but here we have terms that may not be multiples of d.\n\nSince d divides the product, and one of the factors is d itself? No, in this expression, 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13), d is not necessarily a factor. For d to divide this product, it suffices that d divides it, but since d might share factors with the constants, but in this case, d might not divide the expression if it doesn't divide the constant terms or something.\n\nActually, since d divides the entire expression, and d divides d, but in the expression, it's multiplied by other things, I think I confused myself.\n\nThe expression is \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), and d divides this. But d is a divisor, so:\n\n\\[ 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d} \\]\n\nNow, modulo d, d \u2261 0, so the expression modulo d is:\n\n\\[ 3(0+1)(0 - 0 + 13) = 3 \\times 1 \\times 13 = 39 \\pmod{d} \\]\n\nIs that right? When d \u2261 0, so d+1 \u2261 1, d^2 -4d +13 \u2261 0 -0 +13 =13, yes. So modulo d, the expression simplifies to 3*1*13 = 39.\n\nBut for d to divide the expression, the expression modulo d must be 0. But here it's 39, which is not necessarily 0, unless d divides 39.\n\nThe expression is congruent to 39 modulo d, and we need this to be 0 modulo d, meaning that d divides 39.\n\nIs that correct? Let me see.\n\nWe have that the expression is congruent to 39 mod d, and we need the expression to be divisible by d, which implies that 39 must be congruent to 0 mod d, i.e., d | 39.\n\nBut is that sufficient? Almost, but when I substituted, I got that the expression \u2261 39 mod d, so for it to be 0 mod d, yes, d must divide 39.\n\nBut is this always true? I think I made a mistake because if d divides the expression, and the expression is congruent to 39 mod d, then yes, 39 must be congruent to 0 mod d, so d | 39.\n\nBut let me verify with an example.\n\nSuppose n is such that n+2 divides 39. For example, let d=1, so n+2=1, but n is positive integer, so n\u22651, d\u22653? n positive integer, so n\u22651, d=n+2\u22653. But d=1 is not possible.\n\nd must be a positive divisor since n+2 >0.\n\n39 has divisors: \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b113, \u00b139. But since d = n+2 \u2265 3 (since n\u22651), we consider positive divisors greater than or equal to 3: 3,13,39.\n\nd=1 is less than 3, but n+2\u22653? n=1, d=3; n=0 is not positive. So d\u22653, so divisors 3,13,39.\n\nNow, check each.\n\nFirst, d=3, so n+2=3, n=1.\n\nExpression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9)=3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120.\n\nn+2=3, 3 divides 120? Yes, 120/3=40.\n\nGood.\n\nd=13, n+2=13, n=11.\n\nExpression: 3(11+3)(11^2 +9)=3(14)(121+9)=3*14*130.\n\nCompute: 14*130=1820, times 3 is 5460.\n\nn+2=13, 5460 / 13. 13*420=5460, yes, divides.\n\nd=39, n+2=39, n=37.\n\nExpression: 3(37+3)(37^2 +9)=3(40)(1369+9)=3*40*1378.\n\n37^2=1369? 30^2=900, 7^2=49, 2*30*7=420, so 900+420+49=1369, yes. +9=1378.\n\nSo 3*40=120, 120*1378.\n\nBut n+2=39, so check if 39 divides 120*1378.\n\n39=13*3, 120 is divisible by 3 but not by 13, so need to check 1378 /13.\n\n13*106=13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378, yes, so 1378=13*106, so overall 120*1378=120*13*106, divided by 39=13*3, so (120/3)*(13/13)*106=40*1*106=4240, so yes, divisible.\n\nSo far good.\n\nBut the problem asks for sum of all such positive integers, and I have n=1,11,37, sum 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut are there more? Earlier I assumed d|39, and took d=3,13,39.\n\nBut d=1 is not allowed since n= -1 not positive.\n\nd= -1,-3, etc., but since d=n+2>0 for n positive, we don't consider negative divisors.\n\nBut in the divisor list, d=39 has divisors including 1, but we took only the divisors where d\u22653.\n\nBut 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, all positive.\n\nBut is that all? I recall that when I simplified, I got that the expression is congruent to 39 mod d, so d must divide 39. But is this necessary and sufficient?\n\nSuppose d divides the expression, then since expression \u226139 mod d, yes, d|39.\n\nBut is the converse true? If d|39, then expression \u226139 \u22610 mod d, so yes, so it should be sufficient.\n\nBut let me see if there are other possibilities. For example, what if d divides the expression but not 39? But according to the modulo reduction, modulo d, the expression simplifies to 39, so if it's not zero, it can't be divisible by d unless 39 is zero mod d.\n\nUnless d is not coprime to something, but modulo arithmetic should hold regardless.\n\nIn this case, when we substitute, we assumed that modulo d, n\u2261 -2, then expression is 3(-2+3)((-2)^2 +9)=3(1)(4+9)=3*1*13=39, as before.\n\nIs this correct? n+3 = (-2)+3=1, n^2+9=4+9=13, yes.\n\nSo expression is always congruent to 39 modulo d=n+2.\n\nTherefore, d divides the expression if and only if d divides 39.\n\nSo the positive divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39.\n\nd=n+2\u22653, as n\u22651, so d=3,13,39, corresponding to n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, plus 37 is 49.\n\nThe problem says \"find the sum of all such positive integers\", implying there might be more, or perhaps not.\n\nIs n=0 considered? But n positive integer, so no.\n\nWhat about larger divisors? 39 has no other positive divisors.\n\nBut let me check if for these n, it works, which we did.\n\nPerhaps there are cases where d does not divide 39 but still divides the expression, but according to this, it shouldn't.\n\nFor example, suppose d=39 is not the only one, but what about composite divisors or something, but d must divide 39.\n\nPerhaps if d shares a factor with other terms.\n\nSuppose that n+2 divides the product, but in the expression, after substitution, we have that modulo d, it's 39, so it should be necessary.\n\nBut let me consider the polynomial.\n\nSet f(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nWe want n+2 to divide f(n).\n\nNote that n^2 +9 = (n^2 -4) +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13.\n\nAh, that's a better way.\n\nSo f(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2 +9)\n\nAnd n^2 +9 = n^2 -4 +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13\n\nSo f(n) = 3(n+3) [ (n-2)(n+2) + 13 ] = 3(n+3)(n-2)(n+2) + 3(n+3)*13\n\nSo f(n) = 3(n+3)(n-2)(n+2) + 39(n+3)\n\nNow, we want this to be divisible by n+2.\n\nSo when divided by n+2, the first term 3(n+3)(n-2)(n+2) is clearly divisible by n+2, so the remainder when f(n) is divided by n+2 is the same as the remainder when 39(n+3) is divided by n+2.\n\nIs that right? Since the first term is multiple of n+2, yes.\n\nSo f(n) \u2261 39(n+3) \\pmod{n+2}\n\nAnd we need this to be \u22610 \\pmod{n+2}, so 39(n+3) \u22610 \\pmod{n+2}\n\nNow, n+3 = (n+2) +1, so n+3 \u22611 \\pmod{n+2}\n\nTherefore, 39(n+3) \u2261 39 * 1 = 39 \\pmod{n+2}\n\nAgain, same as before, so f(n) \u226139 \\pmod{n+2}, so n+2 must divide 39.\n\nSo same conclusion.\n\nBut in this derivation, I see that f(n) \u226139 \\pmod{n+2}, so d=n+2 must divide 39.\n\nPositive divisors are 1,3,13,39, but d\u22653, so n= -1,1,11,37, but n positive integer, so n=1,11,37.\n\nSum 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1 is included.\n\nBut let me double-check n=1: as before, worked.\n\nn=11 worked, n=37 worked.\n\nIs there any other n? For example, could d be larger if 39 is not covered? Suppose d=117, which is 39*3, but 117 does not divide 39, so no.\n\nPerhaps negative divisors, but since n positive, d=n+2>0, no.\n\nAnother thought: what if n+2 divides the expression, but in the modulo, if n+2 is not prime, but it shouldn't matter.\n\nFor example, let me try n=2. d=4.\n\nf(2)=3(2+3)(4+9)=3*5*13=195.\n\n195 divided by 4? 4*48=192, 195-192=3, not divisible. 195 /4 =48.75, not integer.\n\nAnd d=4 does not divide 39, since 39/4=9.75, not integer.\n\nAnother example, suppose n=7, d=9.\n\nf(7)=3(10)(49+9)=3*10*58=1740.\n\n1740 /9=193.333? 9*193=1737, 1740-1737=3, not divisible. 39 divided by 9 is not integer.\n\nn=25, d=27.\n\nf(25)=3(28)(625+9)=3*28*634.\n\n28*634=28*600=16800, 28*34=952, total 17752, times 3 is 53256.\n\n53256 /27. 27*1972=27*2000=54000 - 27*28=756, so 54000-756=53244, then 53256-53244=12, not divisible.\n\n39/27 not integer.\n\nBut earlier we have the divisor d=39 works, but it's already included.\n\nThe problem is that in the derivation, we assumed that modulo d, it's 39, but actually, when we compute modulo d, we have to be careful if d is composite, but modulo arithmetic should still hold.\n\nNotice that in the expression f(n) \u2261 39(n+3) \\pmod{n+2}, and since n+3 \u22611 \\pmod{n+2}, so it's always congruent to 39, regardless of d.\n\nSo it seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps when d divides one of the terms, but in this case, it's always congruent to 39, so d must divide 39.\n\nBut let me see the polynomial division or something.\n\nI could write that \\frac{3(n+3)(n^2+9)}{n+2} must be an integer.\n\nUsing polynomial division.\n\nFix n+2 as divisor.\n\nSet t = n+2, so n = t-2.\n\nThen f(n) = 3(t-2+3)((t-2)^2 +9) = 3(t+1)(t^2 -4t +4 +9) = 3(t+1)(t^2 -4t +13)\n\nNow, we need this to be divisible by t, meaning that t divides \\( 3(t+1)(t^2-4t+13) \\).\n\nSince t divides this, and t is integer for integer n, we can write that \\( 3(t+1)(t^2-4t+13) / t = 3(t+1)(t - 4 + 13/t) \\), better to expand or consider as polynomial.\n\nSince it's a polynomial in t, and we need it to be integer when divided by t, but actually, for integer t, we need \\( \\frac{3(t+1)(t^2-4t+13)}{t} \\) to be an integer.\n\nSimplify: \\( 3(t+1) \\frac{t^2-4t+13}{t} = 3(t+1) (t - 4 + \\frac{13}{t}) = 3(t+1)(t-4) + 3(t+1)\\frac{13}{t} \\)\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{f(n)}{n+2} = 3(t+1)(t-4) + \\frac{39(t+1)}{t} \\)\n\nNow, 3(t+1)(t-4) is always integer for integer t, since it's a polynomial, but the term \\( \\frac{39(t+1)}{t} \\) needs to contribute such that the whole thing is integer.\n\nSo \\( \\frac{39(t+1)}{t} = 39 + \\frac{39}{t} \\) must be added, but actually, the expression is:\n\n\\( \\frac{f(n)}{n+2} = 3(t+1)(t-4) + \\frac{39(t+1)}{t} \\)\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{39(t+1)}{t} = 39 \\frac{t+1}{t} = 39 (1 + \\frac{1}{t}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{t} \\)\n\nSo overall, \\( 3(t+1)(t-4) + 39 + \\frac{39}{t} \\)\n\nFor this to be an integer, since \\( 3(t+1)(t-4) \\) and 39 are integers, we need \\( \\frac{39}{t} \\) to be an integer.\n\nThus, t must divide 39.\n\nSame conclusion as before.\n\nSo t | 39, and t = n+2 \u2265 3, since n \u2265 1.\n\nDivisors of 39: 1,3,13,39.\n\nt\u22653, so t=3,13,39.\n\nn=1,11,37.\n\nSum=1+11+37=49.\n\nBut is there a possibility that t is negative? But since n positive integer, n\u22651, t\u22653>0, so only positive divisors.\n\nBut what if n is such that n+2=1? Then n=-1, not positive.\n\nOr n+2= -1, n=-3, not positive.\n\nSo only three solutions.\n\nBut let me check if there are more. For example, if t divides 39, but we have all divisors.\n\n39 has prime factors 3 and 13, so divisors 1,3,13,39.\n\nAll covered.\n\nPerhaps when t=1, but n=-1 not allowed.\n\nBut in the expression, for t=1, f(n)= when n=-1, 3(-1+3)(1+9)=3*2*10=60, divided by t=1 is 60, integer, but n not positive.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo only those three.\n\nBut the problem says \"sum of all positive integers\", and perhaps they expect a larger sum, or maybe I missed some.\n\nAnother thought: in the expression \\( \\frac{f(n)}{n+2} = 3(t+1)(t-4) + 39 + \\frac{39}{t} \\), and if t divides 39, then yes, but could there be fractional parts that cancel? No, because the other terms are integer when t is integer, so \\( \\frac{39}{t} \\) must be integer.\n\nUnless t is not integer, but t=n+2 is integer since n integer.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps when t divides the product but not 39, but as per algebra, impossible.\n\nBut let me try a larger n. Suppose n=39-2=37, which we have.\n\nn=13-2=11, n=3-2=1.\n\nn=1 corresponds to d=3.\n\nIs there any other divisor? What about t=39 itself, already have.\n\nOr composite divisors, but no.\n\nPerhaps when t is a divisor of 39 but I listed all.\n\n39=3*13, so divisors are only those four.\n\nPositive:1,3,13,39 with t\u22653.\n\nBut in sum we have n=1,11,37.\n\nSum 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut let me calculate sum: 1+11=12, 37+12=49.\n\nPerhaps they want to include negative n, but it says positive integers.\n\nOr n=0, but n positive, so no.\n\nAnother thought: what if n+2=0, but then division by zero, not allowed, and n=-2 not positive.\n\nSo I think that's all.\n\nBut perhaps I misinterpreted the expression.\n\nThe product is 3(n+3)(n^2+9), and we need n+2 divides it.\n\nNote that n^2 +9 is always positive, n+3>0 for n\u22651, so expression is positive.\n\nFor n=1,11,37 it works.\n\nSum is 49.\n\nBut let me see the answer, or if I made computation error.\n\nn=37, n+2=39, expression 3*(40)*(37^2+9)=3*40*(1369+9)=120*1378.\n\n1378 /13 as before, since 13*106=1378, and 120/3? 39=13*3, and 120 divisible by 3, 120\u00f73=40, so yes, 40*106=4240, integer.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSum 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut perhaps there are more solutions where d does not divide 39.\n\nSuppose that in the expression, if n+2 divides one of the factors, but in this case, n+2 could divide 3, or divide n+3, but since n+3 = (n+2) +1, they are coprime, so n+2 must be coprime to n+3, similarly to n^2+9 possibly.\n\nFor example, if n+2 divides 3, then since it's greater than or equal to 3, it must be 3, because divisors of 3 are 1,3,-1,-3, so d=3, which is already included.\n\nSimilarly, if it divides n+3, but n+3 = (n+2)+1, so if d=n+2 divides (d+1), then d divides (d+1) - d =1, so d|1, d=1, but n=-1 not positive.\n\nSimilarly, if d divides n^2+9.\n\nn^2+9 mod d = (-2)^2 +9=4+9=13, same as before.\n\nSet g(n)=n^2+9, modulo n+2, as above, is 13.\n\nSo unless d and 13 are not coprime, but still, d must divide the entire expression, which is multiple of g(n), but overall it reduces to 39.\n\nSuppose that d=n+2 is such that it shares a factor with n^2+9, but still, for d to divide the product, but in the modulo, it's constrained.\n\nI think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nPerhaps the constant term is absorbed somehow.\n\nAnother way: let me compute for different n.\n\nTry n=3, d=5.\n\nf(3)=3*6*(9+9)=3*6*18=324. 324/5=64.8, not integer.\n\nd does not divide 39.\n\nn=4, d=6, f(4)=3*7*(16+9)=21*25=525. 525/6=87.5, not integer.\n\nn=5, d=7, f(5)=3*8*(25+9)=24*34=816. 816/7\u2248116.57, not integer.\n\nn=6, d=8, f(6)=3*9*(36+9)=27*45=1215. 1215/8=151.875, no.\n\nn=7, d=9, as before, not.\n\nn=8, d=10, f(8)=3*11*(64+9)=33*73=2409. 2409/10=240.9, no.\n\nn=9, d=11, f(9)=3*12*(81+9)=36*90=3240. 3240/11=294.545? 11*294=3234, 3240-3234=6, not zero.\n\nn=10, d=12, f(10)=3*13*(100+9)=39*109=4251. 4251/12? 12*354=4248, 4251-4248=3, not divisible.\n\nn=12, d=14, f(12)=3*15*(144+9)=45*153. 45*150=6750, 45*3=135, total 6885. 6885/14. 14*492=6888? 14*490=6860, 14*2=28, total 6888, too big. 6888-6885=3, so 14*491=14*490=6860, 14*1=14, total 6874?

Then d|3, d\u22653, so d=3, included.\n\nOr if it divides n+3, but as before, impossible under conditions.\n\nSo I think it's complete.\n\nPerhaps negative divisors, but n+2>0, so no.\n\nUnless some n where n+2 is negative, but then n negative, not positive integer.\n\nFor example, if n+2 = -3, then n = -5.\n\nf(-5) = 3(-5+3)(25+9) = 3(-2)(34) = -204.\n\nDivide by n+2 = -3, (-204)/(-3) = 68, integer, but n = -5 not positive.\n\nSimilarly, n+2 = -13, n = -15.\n\nf(-15) = 3(-12)(225+9) = 3*(-12)*234 = -8424.\n\nDivide by -13: 8424 / 13 = 648, since 13*600=7800, 13*48=624, total 8424, so -8424 / -13 = 648, integer.\n\nBut n negative.\n\nn+2 = -39, n = -41, similarly would work, but negative.\n\nAnd n+2 = -1, n = -3, f(-3) = 3(0)(9+9) = 3*0*18 = 0, divide by n+2 = -1, 0/-1 = 0, integer, but n = -3 not positive.\n\nSo no additional positive integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, only n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nSum is 49.\n\nBut let me confirm the sum: 1 + 11 = 12, 12 + 37 = 49.\n\n1, 11, 37 are all distinct.\n\nPerhaps they want the sum including duplicates, but no duplicates.\n\nOr perhaps I missed n=0, but not positive.\n\nAnother thing: when n=3, but earlier not.\n\nOr n=39? n=39, d=41.\n\nf(39)=3(42)(1521+9)=126*1530.\n\nDivide by 41? 41 prime, 126 not divisible by 41, 1530 /41: 41*37=1517, 1530-1517=13, not zero. 39/41 not integer, so no.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps d=117, but 39/117=1/3, not integer, and 117 does not divide 39.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sum is 49.\n\nBut I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes there are more solutions when the divisor shares factors, but in this case, since we derived that n+2 must divide 39, and 39 has only those divisors, I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps when n+2 is a divisor but we forgot d=1, but excluded.\n\nOr in the expression, if we consider that \\frac{39}{n+2} can be fraction but the other terms compensate, but in this case, the other terms 3(n+3)(n-2) is polynomial, so for each integer n, it's integer, so \\frac{39}{n+2} must be integer for the sum to be integer. So no compensation possible because the other term is integer regardless of n+2, as long as n integer.\n\nFor example, if n+2=2, then \\frac{39}{2}=19.5, and 3(n+3)(n-2)=3*(5)*(0)=0 since n-2=0 when d=2? n+2=2, n=0.\n\nThen f(0)=3(3)(0+9)=3*3*9=81, divide by n+2=2, 81/2=40.5, not integer.\n\nIn the expression, r=3(n+3)(n-2) + 39 + \\frac{39}{n+2} = 3*3*(-2) + 39 + 39/2? n=0, n-2=-2, so 3*3*(-2)= -18, plus 39 is 21, plus 39/2=19.5, so 21+19.5=40.5, same.\n\nNot integer.\n\nSimilarly, if n+2=6, n=4, earlier we had f(4)=525, d=6, 525/6=87.5 not integer.\n\nr=3*(4+3)(4-2) +39 +39/6=3*7*2 +39 +6.5=42+39+6.5=87.5.\n\nThe other term doesn't compensate.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, only when \\frac{39}{n+2} is integer, so n+2 must be a positive divisor of 39 greater than or equal to 3.\n\nHence sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nSo the answer should be 49.\n\nBut let me see if the problem says \"positive integers\", and includes 1, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps they consider n>0 strictly, but 1 is fine.\n\nOr sum is 49.\n\nI think that's it.",
        "I need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nIt says that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). In mathematical terms, this means that \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) is divisible by \\( n+2 \\). So, there exists some integer k such that:\n\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = k(n+2) \\]\n\nBut it might be better to work with the division and consider the remainder. Since it's a divisibility condition, I can write:\n\n\\[ 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n+2} \\]\n\nNow, when we work modulo \\( n+2 \\), it's similar to saying that \\( n \\equiv -2 \\pmod{n+2} \\). So, I can substitute \\( n \\) with \\( -2 \\) in the expression to find the value modulo \\( n+2 \\).\n\nThat is, for any polynomial in n, when divided by n+2, the remainder is the polynomial evaluated at n = -2. By the Remainder Theorem, if you divide a polynomial f(n) by n-a, the remainder is f(a). Here, dividing by n+2, which is n - (-2), so yes, remainder is f(-2).\n\nSo, in this case, the expression is \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\), so let me define \\( f(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).\n\nThen, f(n) modulo (n+2) is f(-2).\n\nSo, compute f(-2):\n\nf(-2) = 3(-2 + 3)((-2)^2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3 * 1 * 13 = 39.\n\nSince we're working modulo n+2, and f(n) is divisible by n+2 only if f(n) \u2261 0 mod (n+2), but here f(-2) = 39, which is not zero, but that doesn't mean it's never divisible; no.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that when we divide f(n) by (n+2), the remainder is 39. But for f(n) to be divisible by (n+2), the remainder must be zero. But here I got a constant 39, which is not zero, but that can't be right because for example if n+2 divides f(n), but according to this, the remainder is always 39? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I confused something. The Remainder Theorem says that when you divide a polynomial by a linear divisor, the remainder is constant, and it's f(a) for divisor x-a. So yes, for any n, f(n) = q(n)(n+2) + r, and r = f(-2) = 39. So indeed, f(n) is always equal to some multiple of (n+2) plus 39. That means that f(n) is divisible by n+2 if and only if 39 is divisible by n+2? That is, if n+2 divides 39.\n\nIs that it? Let me see. From f(n) = q(n)(n+2) + 39, so f(n) is divisible by n+2 iff n+2 divides 39.\n\nThat makes sense. So for n+2 to divide f(n), since f(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2), it must be that 39 is congruent to 0 mod (n+2), meaning n+2 | 39.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me verify with an example. Suppose n+2 = 1, then n=-1, but n is positive integer, but just for check. n+2=1, n=-1, f(n)=3(-1+3)(1+9)=3*2*10=60, and 60 divided by 1 is integer, yes. And 39 divided by 1 is also integer.\n\nAnother example, say n+2=3, so n=1, f(1)=3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120, 120 / 3 =40, integer. And 39/3=13, integer.\n\nNow, what if n+2=13, n=11, f(11)=3(14)(121+9)=3*14*130=3*14*130, 14*130=1820, times 3 is 5460, divided by 13: 13*420=5460, yes. 39/13=3, integer.\n\nBut what if n+2 does not divide 39? Say n+2=4, n=2, f(2)=3(5)(4+9)=3*5*13=195, divided by (n+2)=4, 195 / 4 = 48.75, not integer. And 39/4=9.75, not integer. Good.\n\nBut is there a catch? Because in the expression, there is a factor of 3, and when n+2 divides 39, it should be fine.\n\nBut n+2 could be larger than 39, but since it's a divisor, and for positive integers n, n+2 \u22653 if n\u22651, but what if n+2 >39? Then it can't divide 39 unless it's a divisor, but if it's larger than 39 and greater than 0, it can only divide 39 if it divides 39, but divisors are finite.\n\nSince n+2 must divide 39, and n+2 is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n\u22651, n+2\u22653), and divisors of 39 are positive divisors.\n\n39 factors: 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut n+2 \u22653, so exclude 1, so divisors are 3,13,39.\n\nCorresponding n: if n+2=3, n=1.\n\nIf n+2=13, n=11.\n\nIf n+2=39, n=37.\n\nEarlier I checked n=1 and n=11, both worked. Now n=37.\n\nCompute f(37)=3(37+3)(37^2+9)=3(40)(1369+9)=3*40*1378.\n\n37^2=1369, yes, plus 9 is 1378.\n\nSo 3*40=120, times 1378.\n\nFirst, 100*1378=137800, 20*1378=27560, total 137800+27560=165360.\n\nNow divide by n+2=39. Since 39*4240? Better to simplify.\n\nf(37)=3*40*1378.\n\n1378 divided by 13: 13*106=1378, yes since 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378. So 1378=13*106.\n\nSo f(37)=3*40*13*106.\n\nNow n+2=39=3*13.\n\nSo f(37)/(n+2)= (3*40*13*106)/(3*13)=40*106=4240, which is integer, yes.\n\nSo all three work. But the problem asks for the sum of all such n, so sum of 1,11,37. 1+11=12, plus 37 is 49.\n\nBut earlier I thought when n+2=1, but n positive, so n=-1 not allowed. But are there negative divisors? The problem says positive integers n, so n+2 >0, since n\u22651, n+2\u22653>0, so we only consider positive divisors.\n\nBut 39 has negative divisors as well, like -1,-3,-13,-39, but if n+2 is negative, since n is positive integer, n+2\u22653, so we ignore negative divisors.\n\nBut let me confirm: suppose n+2=-3, then n=-5, not positive. Similarly others, so only positive divisors.\n\nBut earlier I got n=1,11,37, sum 49.\n\nBut the expression has a 3 in it, and also (n+3) and (n^2+9), but in my reasoning, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me see the title again: \"n+2 divides the product 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\"\n\nIn my calculation, I assumed n+2 divides f(n), and I concluded that since f(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2), so n+2 must divide 39.\n\nBut is this sufficient? In my examples it works, but is it necessary and sufficient? I think yes, because for any n, f(n) - 39 is divisible by n+2, so f(n) is divisible by n+2 iff 39 is divisible by n+2.\n\nIn other words, n+2 | f(n) iff n+2 | 39.\n\nSince f(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2), and if n+2 divides f(n), then f(n) \u2261 0 mod (n+2), so 39 \u2261 0 mod (n+2), so yes.\n\nConversely, if n+2 | 39, since f(n) = q(n)(n+2) + 39, and if n+2 | 39, then 39 = k(n+2) for some integer k, so f(n) = q(n)(n+2) + k(n+2) = (q(n) + k)(n+2), so divisible.\n\nSo yes, it's both necessary and sufficient.\n\nNow, divisors of 39 are \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139.\n\nn positive integer, so n+2 \u22653, so possible n+2 = 3,13,39 (since positive).\n\nThus n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"sum of all positive integers n\", and I have three values, sum to 49.\n\nBut let me check if there are others. Is there a possibility that when n+2 is larger, but still divides f(n)? For example, if n+2 is a divisor of 39, but since other divisors are negative or 1, which we excluded.\n\nBut what if n+2 divides f(n) but doesn't divide 39? But according to the above, it must divide 39, because f(n) - 39 is divisible by n+2, so if n+2 divides f(n), then it must divide any linear combination, in particular it divides f(n) - 39? No.\n\nf(n) - 39 is divisible by n+2, always, meaning that n+2 | (f(n) - 39).\n\nTherefore, if n+2 | f(n), then since n+2 | (f(n) - 39), then it must divide the difference: but difference is 39.\n\nMore formally: suppose d = n+2.\n\nThen f(n) \u2261 0 mod d, and f(n) \u2261 39 mod d, so 39 \u2261 0 mod d, so d|39.\n\nThus, it must be that n+2 divides 39.\n\nSo only divisors are as above.\n\nBut when I computed f(n), for n=1,11,37 it worked, and for others like n=2 it didn't.\n\nBut is there a case where n+2 is not a divisor but still divides f(n)? For example, suppose n+2 is a divisor of the quotient, but since we have the expression, it should be covered.\n\nTo be thorough, let me write explicitly.\n\nSet d = n+2, then n = d - 2.\n\nThen the expression is 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d+1)( (d^2 - 4d + 4) + 9 ) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)\n\nNow, d = n+2, so this is 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)\n\nWe need this to be divisible by d, that is, d divides 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13).\n\nSince d divides d, and d divides d^2 - 4d + 13? Not necessarily.\n\nMore carefully, for d to divide this expression, since the expression is 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13), and d is coprime to d+1? Not necessarily.\n\nWe can compute this polynomial modulo d.\n\nWhen modulo d, since d\u22610, so expression \u2261 3(0+1)(0 - 0 + 13) = 3*1*13=39 mod d.\n\nSame as before, so \u226139 mod d.\n\nSo d must divide 39.\n\nSame conclusion.\n\nBut let me see if d>39, say d=40, then expression is 3(41)(1600 - 160 + 13)=3*41*(1600-160=1440+13=1453? Let me compute: d=40, n=38, f(n)=3(38+3)(38^2 +9)=3*41*(1444+9)=3*41*1453.\n\n1453 divided by 41 is 35.439? 41*35=1435, 1453-1435=18, not divisible. Total f(n)=3*41*1453, divided by d=40.\n\nSince there is a 40 in denominator, but numerator 3*41*1453, none of which has factor 2 or 5, except that 1453 might. 1453 div 2? odd, not div 5. So overall not divisible by 2 or 5, hence not by 40. So no.\n\nOr d=39, we did, works.\n\nNow, another thing: what if d=13, we had n=11, worked.\n\nBut in the expression 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13), for d=13, it's 3*14*(169-52+13)=3*14*(130)= as before, and divided by 13, since 13 in denominator and 13 in numerator from 130.\n\nBut is there a case where d may not divide 39, but still divides the expression? For example, if d divides 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13), and if d is large, but from the modulo, it's always 39 mod d, so unless d|39, it won't be exactly divisible.\n\nSuppose d divides the expression, but since the expression minus 39 is divisible by d, so if d divides expression, and d divides (expression - 39), then d divides their difference, which is 39. So yes, necessary that d|39.\n\nSo no other possibilities.\n\nBut the problem is about positive integers n, and sum of such n.\n\nI have n=1,11,37.\n\nSum 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if n+2 could be negative, but as before, not for positive n.\n\nWhat if n+2 is zero? But n+2=0, n=-2, not positive.\n\nSo only these three.\n\nBut let me see the answer, or think again.\n\nIn the expression, when I compute f(n), for n=-2, it's undefined or something, but that's fine.\n\nAnother way: since we have n^2+9, which is always positive, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can expand the expression and see.\n\nf(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nExpand: first (n+3)(n^2+9) = n*n^2 + n*9 +3*n^2 +3*9 = n^3 +9n +3n^2 +27 = n^3 +3n^2 +9n +27.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +81.\n\nNow, divide by n+2, and we need this polynomial to be divisible by n+2, but actually, for specific n, but from algebra, we can compute whether it's divisible, but actually, for integer n, we can check when it's integer when divided.\n\nBut earlier method seems fine.\n\nSince we know that 3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +81 must be divisible by n+2.\n\nWe can perform polynomial division and find the remainder.\n\nDivide 3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +81 by n+2.\n\nUsing polynomial division:\n\nDivide leading term 3n^3 / n = 3n^2. Multiply by n+2: 3n^2 * n = 3n^3, 3n^2 * 2 = 6n^2.\n\nSubtract: (3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +81) - (3n^3 +6n^2) = (9n^2 - 6n^2) +27n +81 = 3n^2 +27n +81.\n\nNow, 3n^2 / n = 3n. Multiply by n+2: 3n*n=3n^2, 3n*2=6n.\n\nSubtract: (3n^2 +27n +81) - (3n^2 +6n) = (27n-6n) +81 = 21n +81.\n\nNow, 21n / n = 21. Multiply by n+2: 21*n=21n, 21*2=42.\n\nSubtract: (21n +81) - (21n +42) = 81 - 42 = 39.\n\nSo remainder is 39. Exactly as before.\n\nSo f(n) = (n+2)(3n^2 + 3n + 21) + 39? Let me check.\n\nFrom division: quotient is 3n^2 + 3n + 21, since first term 3n^2, then 3n, then 21.\n\nAnd (n+2)(3n^2 + 3n + 21) = n(3n^2+3n+21) + 2(3n^2+3n+21) = 3n^3 +3n^2 +21n +6n^2 +6n +42 = 3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +42.\n\nThen f(n) = 3n^3+9n^2+27n+81, so f(n) - [3n^3+9n^2+27n+42] = 39, so yes, f(n) = (n+2)(3n^2+3n+21) + 39.\n\nTherefore, indeed, for f(n) to be divisible by (n+2), we need (n+2) to divide 39.\n\nSince n is positive integer, n+2 \u2265 3, and divisors of 39 are positive divisors: 1,3,13,39, exclude 1, so 3,13,39.\n\nThus n+2 = 3 \u21d2 n=1\n\nn+2=13 \u21d2 n=11\n\nn+2=39 \u21d2 n=37\n\nNow sum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut 1+11+37=49, yes.\n\nIs n=37 positive? Yes. All good.\n\nBut earlier when I computed n=1, f(1)=3*4*10=120, divided by n+2=3, 120/3=40, integer.\n\nn=11, f(11)=3*14*(121+9)=3*14*130=3*14*130, 14*130=1820, times 3=5460, div by 13: 13*420=5460, yes.\n\nn=37, as before, worked.\n\nIs there any other divisor? What about n+2=1, but n=-1 not positive.\n\nOr negative, no.\n\nBut 39 divided by say 39, we have, but also, could n+2 divide 39 with other factors? No, since it must be an integer divisor.\n\nPerhaps if n+2 is negative, but n positive, no.\n\nOr zero, impossible.\n\nAnother thing: when n+2 divides 39, but in the quotient, there might be division only if n+2 is integer, which it is.\n\nPerhaps for large n, but as we saw, not.\n\nBut let me think: suppose n+2 is a divisor of 39, but we have all.\n\n39's positive divisors are 1,3,13,39 only.\n\nAll covered.\n\nBut why do I feel like maybe there are more? Because in the expression, there is a factor that might cancel, but in this case, since we have exact remainder, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for n such that denominator is zero, but n+2 \u22600 since n\u2260-2.\n\nAnother thought: when I set n\u2261-2 mod d, and computed f(-2)=39, but what if n+2 is zero, but it's not.\n\nOr perhaps if d divides the polynomial coefficient, but no.\n\nLet me try n=0, but n positive integer, so n\u22651, but if n=0, not positive, but f(0)=3(3)(9)=81, n+2=2, 81/2=40.5 not integer.\n\nOr n=-3, but not positive.\n\nn= -1, n+2=1, f(-1)=3(2)(1+9)=3*2*10=60, div by 1 is 60, but n not positive.\n\nNow, just to be sure, let me check n=3. n+2=5, f(3)=3(6)(9+9)=3*6*18=324, 324 / 5 =64.8 not integer. 39/5=7.8 not integer.\n\nn=4, n+2=6, f(4)=3(7)(16+9)=3*7*25=525, 525/6=87.5 not integer.\n\nn=39-2=37 already have.\n\nOr n=13-2=11 have.\n\nIs 39 divisible by more? Like 1,3,13,39, yes.\n\nBut what about n+2=39/k for some k, but no, it has to be integer divisor.\n\nAnother way: set d=n+2, then we need d | 3(d-2+3)((d-2)^2+9) earlier I computed as 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)\n\nNow, this is 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)\n\nAnd we need d to divide this.\n\nSince d and d^2-4d+13 might not be coprime, but in this expression, for integer d, it must divide.\n\nBut as computed, since it equals some polynomial times d plus 39, so same as before.\n\nWe can compute gcd or something, but not necessary.\n\nNote that if d divides 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13), since d divides d, we can reduce.\n\nSet g(d) = 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)\n\nWe need g(d) \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nBut g(d) = 3d(d^2-4d+13) / ? Wait no.\n\ng(d) = 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)\n\nEvaluate modulo d: g(d) \u2261 3(1)(0-0+13) \u2261 3*13\u226139 mod d, since d\u22610.\n\nSame thing.\n\nFor g(d) to be divisible by d, since g(d) = 3d(d^2-4d+13) - something? Let me expand.\n\ng(d) = 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13) = 3 [ d(d^2-4d+13) + 1*(d^2-4d+13) ] = 3 [ d^3 -4d^2 +13d + d^2 -4d +13 ] = 3 [ d^3 -3d^2 +9d +13 ]\n\nSo g(d) = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nEarlier when I had in terms of n, it was similar.\n\nSo g(d) = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nNow, since we are working modulo d, and d| d, so d| 3d^3, d|-9d^2, d|27d, but constant term is 39, so modulo d is 39, so same as before.\n\nExplicitly, g(d) = d(3d^2 -9d +27) + 39\n\nSame as before, since earlier with n, we had similar.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, d must divide 39.\n\nThus only possibilities are d=3,13,39, n=1,11,37, sum=1+11+37=49.\n\nBut let me confirm the sum: 1+37=38, plus 11 is 49. Yes.\n\nIs 1 considered a positive integer? Yes.\n\nNow, in the expression, when n=1, n+3=4, n^2+9=10, product with 3 is 120, divided by n+2=3, 40, integer.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut the problem is to sum them, so 49.\n\nBut I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes there are cases where the divisor shares common factors, but in this case, since we have the exact remainder, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps when d divides the remainder, but here remainder is constant 39.\n\nAnother thought: what if d is negative? But if d=n+2 is negative, say d=-3, then n=-5, but n positive? The problem says positive integers n, so n>0, so n+2>2>0, so d>0.\n\nThus only positive divisors.\n\nPerhaps d=1, but n+2=1, n=-1<0, invalid.\n\nSo only three values.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any divisor I missed.\n\n39's divisors are \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139. Positive:1,3,13,39. Excluding 1 since d\u22653, so d=3,13,39 only.\n\nPerhaps d=39, but we have it.\n\nOr d=13,3, all good.\n\nNow, sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut 49 is 7^2, but I don't know.\n\nPerhaps they include others.\n\nAnother thing: in the expression, (n^2+9), and for example if n+2 divides n^2+9 or something.\n\nSet m=n+2, then as before.\n\nSuppose that n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nNote that n \u2261 -2 mod m, where m=n+2.\n\nThen n^2 +9 \u2261 (-2)^2 +9=4+9=13 mod m.\n\nn+3 \u2261 -2+3=1 mod m.\n\nSo overall, 3*1*13=39 mod m.\n\nSame thing.\n\nSo really, it must divide 39.\n\nPerhaps for some n, m divides 39, but also if m divides the expression when m divides 39 even if m larger, but no, because if m>39 and positive, it cannot divide 39 unless divisor, but divisors are only up to 39.\n\nFor example, m=117, which is not divisor of 39, and as we saw earlier for m=40 it didn't work.\n\nTo be thorough, if m=39, it works; if m=78? n+2=78, n=76.\n\nf(76)=3(76+3)(76^2 +9)=3*79*(5776+9)=3*79*5785.\n\nDivide by 78.\n\nCompute: 78=78, numerator 3*79*5785.\n\n5785 div by 5? ends with 5, yes, 5785 /5=1157.\n\nSo 3*79*5785.\n\n78=2*3*13.\n\nNow, numerator: 3 is there, 79 is prime? yes probably.\n\n5785 divided by 5: 5785 /5=1157.\n\n1157 divided by 13: 13*89=1157? 13*80=1040, 13*9=117, total 1040+117=1157, yes. So 1157=5*13*89? 1157=5*1157/5, but earlier 5785=5*1157, and 1157=13*89, since 13*89=1157.\n\n89 is prime, I think.\n\nSo total numerator: 3 * 79 * 5785 = 3 * 79 * 5 * 1157 = 3 * 79 * 5 * 13 * 89.\n\n5785=5*1157=5*13*89.\n\nSo overall: 3 * 79 * 5 * 13 * 89.\n\nDenominator is 78=2*3*13.\n\nSo f(n)/(n+2) = [3 * 79 * 5 * 13 * 89] / [2 * 3 * 13] = (79 * 5 * 89) / 2 = 79*5*89 / 2.\n\n79 and 89 odd, 5 odd, so numerator odd, not divisible by 2? 5*89=445, times 79.\n\nBut denominator has 2, and numerator is odd since all factors odd, so not integer. Indeed, or compute: 445*79 /2.\n\n445/5=89, but anyway, not integer. So yes, not divisible.\n\nSimilarly, for other numbers.\n\nSo only the three we have.\n\nPerhaps when d divides 39, but also if d divides the quotient, but since the quotient is polynomial with integer coefficients, and for integer d, it might introduce more, but in this case, the condition is forced to be d|39.\n\nAnother way to think: the fraction [3(n+3)(n^2+9)] / (n+2) needs to be an integer.\n\nFrom polynomial division, it is 3n^2 + 3n + 21 + 39/(n+2), as we had.\n\nEarlier quotient was 3n^2 + 3n + 21, plus 39/(n+2).\n\nSo for this to be an integer, since 3n^2+3n+21 is always an integer for integer n, we need 39/(n+2) to be integer, meaning n+2 divides 39.\n\nExactly so.\n\nThus, conclusively, n+2 must be a positive divisor of 39 greater than or equal to 3, i.e., 3,13,39.\n\nThus n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nSo the answer should be 49.\n\nBut let me add again: 1+37=38, 38+11=49. Yes.\n\nIs 1 considered acceptable? n=1 is positive integer, and it satisfies, as we checked.\n\nPerhaps the problem thinks n positive integers starting from 1, so yes.\n\nSo I think that's all.\n\nBut I recall that in some problems, they might exclude n where denominator is zero, but here no.\n\nPerhaps when n+3=0, but n=-3, not positive.\n\nSo I think complete.\n\nThus the sum is 49.\n\nSo the answer is \\( 49 \\).\n\nBut let me see the box.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"positive integers n\", and I have sum 49.\n\nPerhaps someone might think n+2 could be 1, but n=-1 invalid.\n\nOr perhaps they include it, but no.\n\nAnother thing: divisors of 39 include 1 and 39, but 1 corresponds to n=-1, invalid, and 39 to n=37 valid.\n\nWe have all.\n\nPerhaps fractional, but no, integers.\n\nThus, I think correct.\n",
        "I need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\). Let's start by understanding the requirement: \\( n + 2 \\) must be a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\). In mathematical terms, this means that \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\) is divisible by \\( n + 2 \\), or equivalently, when I divide \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\) by \\( n + 2 \\), the remainder is zero.\n\nSince \\( n + 2 \\) is a factor, I could perform polynomial division to simplify the expression. Let me denote the expression as \\( f(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\). I need to find when \\( f(n) \\) is divisible by \\( n + 2 \\).\n\nI recall that for a polynomial \\( p(x) \\), \\( p(a) = 0 \\) if and only if \\( (x - a) \\) is a factor. But here, it's \\( n + 2 \\), which is like \\( n - (-2) \\), so if I evaluate \\( f(-2) \\), and if it's zero, then \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( f(n) \\), but that might not be sufficient because there's a constant multiple, and also \\( n \\) is an integer, not necessarily making the polynomial zero.\n\nIn this case, \\( f(n) \\) is a polynomial, and \\( n + 2 \\) is a linear factor. But \\( f(-2) \\) might not be zero, and still \\( n + 2 \\) could divide \\( f(n) \\) for integer n, because division here is in the integer sense, not polynomial sense. Since \\( n + 2 \\) divides the expression for integer n, I should treat this as a divisibility condition in integers.\n\nSo, let me set \\( d = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = d - 2 \\).\n\nNow, substitute into the expression: \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = 3((d-2)+3)((d-2)^2 + 9) = 3(d+1)((d^2 - 4d + 4) + 9) = 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nSo the expression becomes \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nNow, \\( n + 2 = d \\), so d must divide \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nNote that d divides this expression, but d also appears in the expression, so when we say d divides the whole thing, since d and d+1 are coprime (consecutive integers), and d and d^2 - 4d + 13 might have some relation.\n\nSince d divides \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\), and d and d+1 are coprime, d must divide 3 times the other factor, but it's a product, so actually, since d and d+1 have no common factors, d must divide 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), but d divides itself, so it's a bit messy.\n\nNote that \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\) is an integer, and d divides it, so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)}{d} \\] must be an integer.\n\nWhich simplifies to \\( 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) \\), better to write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)}{d} = 3(d+1) \\cdot \\frac{d^2 - 4d + 13}{d} = 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) \\]\n\nSince this must be an integer, and d is an integer, the expression inside must be such that when multiplied, it gives an integer. In particular, \\( \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)}{d} \\) must be integer, so \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nAs noted, d and d+1 are coprime, so d must divide \\( 3(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\). Because if d divides A*B and gcd(d,A)=1, then d divides B. Here A is d+1, and gcd(d, d+1)=1, yes.\n\nMoreover, since d divides 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), and d divides any linear combination, but specifically, d divides 3(d^2 - 4d + 13).\n\nSet g(d) = 3(d^2 - 4d + 13). Then d must divide g(d).\n\nBut g(d) = 3d^2 - 12d + 39.\n\nSince d divides g(d), we have that g(d) is a multiple of d, so \\( g(d) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d} \\).\n\nBut g(d) = 3d^2 - 12d + 39.\n\nModulo d, any polynomial modulo d, since d might not be prime, but for modulo d, when we evaluate g(d) mod d, since d is integer, g(d) mod d is the remainder when g(d) is divided by d.\n\nNote that d^2 \u2261 0 mod d, d \u2261 0 mod d, so 3d^2 - 12d + 39 \u2261 0 + 0 + 39 \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}.\n\nIs that right? When we say g(d) modulo d, since d^k for k\u22651 is divisible by d, so yes, g(d) \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}, because the other terms have d as a factor.\n\nSo g(d) \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}.\n\nBut we require that d divides g(d), so g(d) \u2261 0 \\pmod{d}, which implies that 39 \u2261 0 \\pmod{d}, so d divides 39.\n\nIs that correct? From g(d) \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}, and g(d) \u2261 0 \\pmod{d}, so 39 \u2261 0 \\pmod{d}, yes, so d | 39.\n\nBut earlier I said d must divide 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), but actually, since d divides g(d), and g(d) \u2261 39 \\pmod{d}, so yes, d | 39.\n\nBut is that sufficient? Let me check.\n\nd | 39, and we have that d divides 3(d+1)(d^2 - 4d + 13), and since d | 39, and 39 is constant, but actually, in the expression, we need d to divide the entire product, not just g(d).\n\nEarlier I argued that since gcd(d, d+1)=1, d must divide 3(d^2 - 4d + 13), and then d must divide 39.\n\nBut let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose d | 39, so d is a divisor of 39. Since n is positive integer, d = n+2 > 2, probably, but n positive integer, so d \u2265 3.\n\nn positive integer, so n \u2265 1, d = n+2 \u2265 3.\n\nDivisors of 39 are positive and negative, but since d = n+2 \u2265 3 >0, we consider only positive divisors.\n\n39 = 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut d \u2265 3, so d=3,13,39.\n\nd=1 is excluded because n\u22651, d\u22653.\n\nNow, let me check for each of these if indeed n+2 divides the expression.\n\nFirst, d=3, so n = d-2 =1.\n\nExpression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3(1+3)(1^2 +9) = 3*4*10 = 120.\n\nn+2=3, 120 / 3 = 40, integer, yes.\n\nSecond, d=13, n=11.\n\nExpression: 3(11+3)(11^2 +9) = 3*14*(121+9)=3*14*130=3*1820=5460.\n\nn+2=13, 5460 / 13. Compute: 13*420=5460, yes, since 13*400=5200, 13*20=260, total 5460.\n\nThird, d=39, n=37.\n\nExpression: 3(37+3)(37^2 +9)=3*40*(1369+9)=120*1378.\n\n1369+9=1378, yes.\n\n120*1378. But no need, since we divide by n+2=39.\n\nSo, 3*40*1378 / 39.\n\nFirst, 40/ something, but better compute numerically.\n\nNote that 39 divides it? Since d=39, and we have 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13)=3*40*(1521 - 156 +13), d^2=1521, 4d=156, so 1521-156=1365, plus 13? d^2 -4d +13=1521 - 156 +13=1384? 1521-156=1365, 1365+13=1378.\n\nSo 3*40*1378.\n\nDivide by 39: since 39=3*13, and 3*40*1378 / 39 = 40*1378 / 13.\n\n1378 / 13: 13*106=1378, because 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378.\n\nSo 40*106=4240, integer. Yes.\n\nBut earlier I said d must divide 39, but are there more? What about negative divisors? But since d=n+2\u22653>0, negative divisors aren't considered, as n positive integer.\n\nBut d=1 and d=3,13,39 are positive divisors, but d=1 corresponds to n=-1, not positive, so excluded.\n\nBut earlier I thought d must divide 39, but let me see if there are more possibilities.\n\nBecause when I said d divides 3(d^2 -4d +13), and then concluded d|39, but is that correct?\n\ng(d)=3d^2 -12d +39.\n\nd divides g(d), i.e., d | 3d^2 -12d +39.\n\nBut 3d^2 -12d is clearly divisible by d, since both terms have d, so d | (3d^2 -12d +39) - (3d^2 -12d) =39.\n\nMore carefully: since d | 3d^2 -12d (because each term divisible by d), and d | (3d^2 -12d +39), so d must divide the difference, which is 39.\n\nYes, exactly. So d | 39.\n\nBut is this sufficient? In each case we checked, it worked.\n\nBut let me see the expression \\( \\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13)}{d} \\).\n\nSince d and d+1 are coprime, for this to be integer, since d is in denominator, but we have other terms, but because they are coprime, d must divide 3(d^2 -4d +13), but then as above, d|39.\n\nBut notice that in the expression, d^2 -4d +13 is an integer, and when we divide by d, we get d -4 + 13/d, so for the whole thing to be integer, 13/d must be integer, but that would imply d|13, but earlier we have d|39, which is less restrictive.\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nIn the expression \\( 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) \\), for this to be integer, since d+1 is integer, but d-4 is integer, but we have \\(\\frac{13}{d}\\), so unless d divides 13, this fraction alone might not be integer, but when multiplied by d+1, it might become integer if d+1 provides the necessary factors.\n\nFor example, if d divides 13, say d=13, \\(\\frac{13}{d}=1\\), integer.\n\nBut for d=3, \\(\\frac{13}{3}\\) is not integer, but in the expression, we have \\(3(d+1) \\times \\frac{13}{d}\\), etc.\n\nSpecific example: d=3, we computed it worked.\n\nd=3, expression: \\(3(3+1)(3-4 +13/3) = 3*4*( -1 + 13/3) =12*( -1 + 4.333...)\\), messy.\n\nBetter: \\(3(d+1)(d -4 + 13/d) = 3(d+1) \\cdot (d-4) + 3(d+1) \\cdot \\frac{13}{d}\\).\n\nWith d=3: \\(3*4*(3-4) + 3*4*\\frac{13}{3} = 12*(-1) + 4*13 = -12 + 52 =40\\), which is integer, and indeed earlier computation gave 40.\n\nThe fractional part is compensated by the integer part.\n\nSo, in this case, even though d does not divide 13, because we have the factor (d+1), which might share factors with d, but wait no, d and d+1 are coprime, so actually, \\(\\frac{13}{d}\\) must be such that when multiplied by 3(d+1), it becomes integer.\n\nSince gcd(d, d+1)=1, the denominator d must divide 13, but that's not true because in this case for d=3, 3 does not divide 13, yet it worked.\n\nContradiction.\n\nNo: in the expression, we have \\(\\frac{13}{d}\\), and it's multiplied by 3(d+1), and since gcd(d, d+1)=1, for \\(\\frac{3(d+1) \\cdot 13}{d}\\) to be integer, d must divide \\(43 \\times 13 = 559\\), no.\n\n\\(\\frac{3(d+1) \\cdot 13}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} + \\text{something}\\), better: \\(\\frac{3(d+1) \\cdot 13}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} = 39 (1 + \\frac{1}{d}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{d}\\).\n\nSo for this part alone, but this is only part of the expression.\n\nBack to the entire quotient: \\(\\frac{3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13)}{d} = 3(d+1) \\cdot \\frac{d^2 -4d +13}{d} = 3(d+1) \\left( d - 4 + \\frac{13}{d} \\right) = 3(d+1)(d-4) + 3(d+1)\\frac{13}{d}\\).\n\nNow, \\(3(d+1)(d-4)\\) is always an integer since d integer, and \\(3(d+1)\\frac{13}{d} = \\frac{39(d+1)}{d}\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\frac{39(d+1)}{d} = 39 \\cdot \\frac{d+1}{d} = 39(1 + \\frac{1}{d}) = 39 + \\frac{39}{d}\\).\n\nSo the entire expression is \\(3(d+1)(d-4) + 39 + \\frac{39}{d} = 3(d+1)(d-4) + 39 + \\frac{39}{d}\\).\n\nThis must be an integer.\n\nSince \\(3(d+1)(d-4) + 39\\) is already an integer, for the sum to be integer, \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) must be an integer. Because the other part is integer.\n\nIs that right? \\(3(d+1)(d-4) + 39\\) is integer, and \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) is added, so for the sum to be integer, \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) must be integer, meaning d must divide 39.\n\nBut earlier for d=3, \\(\\frac{39}{d}=13\\), integer, yes.\n\nIn the expression above, I have \\(3(d+1)(d-4) + 39 + \\frac{39}{d}\\), and since \\(3(d+1)(d-4) + 39\\) is integer, and we're adding \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\), so yes, \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) must be integer for the sum to be integer.\n\nBut earlier I computed for d=3, it was 40, and 40 is integer, and \\( \\frac{39}{3}=13\\), integer, so it matches.\n\nBut what about the whole quotient? The quotient is exactly that sum, so yes.\n\nIn my calculation for d=3, I got 40, which matches what I computed earlier (120/3=40).\n\nSimilarly, for any divisor of 39, it should work, and we have d=3,13,39 as above.\n\nBut 39 has divisors \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139, but since d>0 and d\u22653, so d=3,13,39 only? But what about d=1? n=-1 not positive. d=39 we have.\n\nBut is there more? What about negative divisors? But d=n+2\u22653>0, so no.\n\nEarlier I thought d must divide 39, but let me confirm with another divisor.\n\nSay d=1, even though n not positive. If d=1, n=-1.\n\nExpression: 3(-1+3)((-1)^2 +9)=3*2*(1+9)=6*10=60.\n\nn+2=1, 60/1=60, integer. So it works, but n not positive.\n\nSimilarly, d=13, worked; d=39, worked; d=3, worked.\n\nNow, d=39 is included.\n\nBut are there other divisors? 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39.\n\nThat's all positive divisors.\n\nBut the problem asks for sum of all positive integers n, so n=d-2, so for d=3, n=1; d=13, n=11; d=39, n=37.\n\nSum: 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut is that all? Earlier I thought that \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) must be integer, so d|39, so only these.\n\nBut let me see if there are cases where d does not divide 39 but still works.\n\nFor example, suppose d=6. Is there reason? d=6 does not divide 39, since 39 not divisible by 2.\n\nn=6-2=4.\n\nExpression: 3(4+3)(16+9)=3*7*25=525.\n\nn+2=6, 525 / 6 = 87.5, not integer. Indeed.\n\nd=9, n=7.\n\n3(7+3)(49+9)=3*10*58=1740.\n\nn+2=9, 1740 / 9 = 193.333? 9*193=1737, 1740-1737=3, not divisible. 1740 / 9 = 1740 \u00f7 9. 9*193=1737, remainder 3, not integer.\n\nd=13, already did.\n\nd=15, n=13.\n\n3(13+3)(169+9)=3*16*178=48*178.\n\n178*50=8900, minus 178*2=356, so 8900-356=8544.\n\nn+2=15, 8544 / 15. 15*569=8535? 15*500=7500, 15*69=1035, total 8535, 8544-8535=9, so not divisible.\n\nd=39, done.\n\nd=1, not positive n.\n\nBut what about d= -1? If d=n+2=-1, n=-3, not positive.\n\nBut d negative, n negative, not positive integers.\n\nBut in the division, we assumed d positive, but actually, since d=n+2, and n positive, d\u22653, so positive.\n\nBut earlier when I said \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) must be integer, but if d is negative, it might still work, but n not positive.\n\nSo for positive n, only d=3,13,39.\n\nCorresponding n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, plus 37=49.\n\nBut let me see if I missed any divisor. 39's divisors: 1,3,13,39. Yes.\n\nBut when d=1, it worked but n not positive.\n\nNow, but in the expression, there is another possibility: what if d divides the entire expression but not necessarily divides 39? But according to the derivation, we must have d|39.\n\nBut in the expression \\(3(d+1)(d-4) + 39 + \\frac{39}{d}\\), for this to be integer, since the first two terms are integers only if d is integer, which it is, but \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) must be integer because it's added to integers. So yes, necessary and sufficient that d|39.\n\nBut why did it work for d=3? Because 39/3=13, integer.\n\nBut earlier I mistakenly thought that d must divide 13, but no, because we have 39, not 13.\n\nIn fact, since \\(\\frac{39}{d}\\) appears, it must be integer.\n\nAnother way: since \\( d \\mid 3(d+1)(d^2-4d+13) \\), and since d and d+1 are coprime, as established, so gcd(d,d+1)=1, thus d must divide \\( 3(d^2-4d+13) \\). Then, as before, \\( 3(d^2-4d+13) \\) modulo d is 39, so d|39.\n\nTo write it as: \\( d \\mid 3d^2 -12d +39 \\), and since d|3d^2 and d|12d, it divides the constant term 39.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the positive divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39, but d\u22653, so d=3,13,39.\n\nn=1,11,37.\n\nSum: 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"sum of all positive integers n\", so 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are others.\n\nSuppose d divides 39 only, but what if d divides the expression in some other way, say if d and d+1 are not coprime, but they are always coprime.\n\nFor example, if d=0, but d=n+2\u22653, not zero.\n\nOr if d=2, but d\u22653? n\u22651, d\u22653, d=2 gives n=0, not positive.\n\nBut for curiosity, if d=2, n=0.\n\nExpression: 3(0+3)(0+9)=3*3*9=81.\n\nn+2=2, 81/2=40.5, not integer.\n\nd=\u22121, n=\u22123.\n\nExpression: 3(-3+3)(9+9)=3*0*18=0.\n\nn+2=\u22121, 0 / (-1) =0, integer, but n not positive.\n\nNow, another thing: in the expression \\( \\frac{39}{d} \\), if d is negative, but as said, n not positive.\n\nBut for completeness, if we allow negative divisors, d=\u22121,\u22123,\u221213,\u221239.\n\nd=n+2, so for d=\u22121, n=\u22123; d=\u22123,n=\u22125; d=\u221213,n=\u221215; d=\u221239,n=\u221241. All negative, so discard.\n\nNow, so positive n are 1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut 49 is 7^2, but why not.\n\nBut the answer seems straightforward, but let me see the original expression.\n\nNotice that n^2 +9, and n+2, perhaps I can factor or something.\n\nSince n+2 divides the expression, and expression is polynomial, I could perform polynomial division and see when the remainder is zero.\n\nLet h(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2 +9).\n\nDivide by n+2.\n\nPerform polynomial division.\n\nFirst, write h(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nExpand: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) = 3 [n*n^2 + n*9 +3*n^2 +3*9] = 3[n^3 +9n +3n^2 +27] = 3[n^3 + 3n^2 +9n +27] = 3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +81.\n\nNow, divide by n+2.\n\nUsing synthetic division, root -2.\n\nCoefficients of h(n): 3n^3 + 9n^2 +27n +81, so 3,9,27,81.\n\nSynthetic division with root -2.\n\nBring down 3.\n\nMultiply by -2: 3*-2=-6.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 9 + (-6) =3.\n\nMultiply by -2: 3*-2=-6.\n\nAdd to next: 27 + (-6)=21.\n\nMultiply by -2: 21*-2=-42.\n\nAdd to last: 81 + (-42)=39.\n\nSo quotient is 3n^2 + 3n +21, and remainder 39.\n\nSo h(n) = (n+2)(3n^2 + 3n +21) + 39.\n\nFor n+2 to divide h(n), it must divide the remainder 39, when n is integer.\n\nThat is, (n+2) | 39.\n\nExactly as before.\n\nSo the remainder is 39, so for h(n) to be divisible by n+2, we need n+2 divides 39.\n\nSince n positive integer, n+2 \u2265 3, and n+2 | 39, so n+2 can be 3,13,39.\n\nThus n=1,11,37.\n\nSum: 1+11+37=49.\n\nSince 39 has positive divisors 1,3,13,39, and exclude those \u22642? n+2\u22653, so divisor \u22653, so d\u22653, so 3,13,39, as above.\n\nSum n = (d-2) for d in {3,13,39}, so n=1,11,37, sum 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nNow, the problem asks for sum of all such n, so answer should be 49.\n\nBut let me see if n=37 is correct, we did.\n\nn=1: 3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120, / (1+2)=3, 120/3=40, yes.\n\nn=11: 3(14)(121+9)=42*130=5460, /13=420, yes.\n\nn=37: 3(40)(37^2+9)=120*(1369+9)=120*1378.\n\n1378 / 2 =689, but better divide by n+2=39.\n\n39=13*3, 120/3=40, so 40*1378 /13.\n\n1378 /13: 13*106=1378, as before, so 40*106=4240, yes.\n\nSum 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nIs there any other n? What if n+2 is a divisor but we missed some? Or if n+2 negative, but n positive, no.\n\nPerhaps n+2 could be larger, but no, divisors are fixed.\n\nAnother thought: when I say n+2 divides 39, it means that h(n) \u2261 0 mod (n+2), and from polynomial division, h(n) \u2261 39 mod (n+2), so yes, equivalent to n+2 | 39.\n\nSo no other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 49.\n\nBut the answer format says box it.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut let me see the problem again: \"find the sum of all positive integers n such that n+2 divides the product 3(n+3)(n^2 +9).\"\n\nNote that n^2 +9, which is always positive, no issue.\n\nAlso, n+3 is positive for n\u22651, so all terms positive, good.\n\nSo answer should be 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut 1+11 is 12, 12+37=49, or 1+37=38, plus 11=49.\n\nSo \\boxed{49}\n\nBut let me see if n=37 is positive integer, yes.\n\nPerhaps they exclude n=1, but why?\n\nMaybe when n+2=1, n=-1, but we already excluded.\n\nOr perhaps n=0, but n positive, so \u22651.\n\nAnother way: list divisors.\n\nSet k=n+2, k\u22653, k|39, so k=3,13,39.\n\nn=k-2, so 1,11,37.\n\nSum=49.\n\nIf we include k=1, n=-1, but not positive.\n\nSo I think correct.\n\nSo the answer is 49.\n",
        "I need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n+2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\). Let me start by understanding what it means for \\( n+2 \\) to divide that expression. It means that when I compute \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) divided by \\( n+2 \\), I should get an integer. In other words, \\( n+2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\).\n\nSince it's a division, and \\( n \\) is a variable, I should perform polynomial division or use algebra to simplify the expression. Let me denote the expression as \\( d = n+2 \\), but maybe that's not necessary. I can consider dividing \\( 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\) by \\( n+2 \\) and see what the quotient and remainder are.\n\nSince \\( n+2 \\) is a linear divisor, I can use the factor theorem or evaluate at \\( n = -2 \\) to find possible values.\n\nSet \\( d = n+2 \\), then \\( n = d - 2 \\). Substitute this into the expression.\n\nSo, \\( n + 3 = (d - 2) + 3 = d + 1 \\)\n\n\\( n^2 + 9 = (d - 2)^2 + 9 = d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9 = d^2 - 4d + 13 \\)\n\nTherefore, the product is \\( 3 \\times (d + 1) \\times (d^2 - 4d + 13) \\)\n\nAnd we want \\( d \\) to divide this product. Since \\( d = n+2 \\), and n is a positive integer, d is an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since n \u2265 1, d \u2265 3).\n\nn is positive integer, so n \u2265 1, thus d = n+2 \u2265 3.\n\nNow, d divides \\( 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) \\).\n\nLet me denote this expression as P(d) = 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)\n\nI need d | P(d), meaning that P(d) is divisible by d, so P(d) / d is an integer.\n\nSince d divides the product, and d might have factors in common with the constants, but to ensure divisibility, I need that when I compute P(d) / d, it's an integer.\n\nBut P(d) is a cubic polynomial, so P(d)/d is a quadratic, but it might not be integer-valued if d doesn't divide evenly.\n\nI should compute P(d) and divide by d.\n\nSo, P(d) = 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13)\n\nLet me expand this.\n\nFirst, (d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13) = d * d^2 + d*(-4d) + d*13 + 1*d^2 + 1*(-4d) + 1*13 = d^3 - 4d^2 + 13d + d^2 - 4d + 13 = d^3 - 3d^2 + 9d + 13\n\nDouble-check:\n\nd * d^2 = d^3\n\nd * (-4d) = -4d^2\n\nd * 13 = 13d\n\n1 * d^2 = d^2\n\n1 * (-4d) = -4d\n\n1 * 13 = 13\n\nSo altogether: d^3 -4d^2 + 13d + d^2 -4d + 13 = d^3 + (-4d^2 + d^2) + (13d - 4d) + 13 = d^3 -3d^2 +9d +13\n\nYes.\n\nThen P(d) = 3 * that = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nNow, we need d divides this, so d | 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nSince d divides any multiple of itself, obviously d divides 3d^3, d divides -9d^2, and d divides 27d, because these are all divisible by d.\n\nIn polynomial terms, for integer d, d divides any polynomial multiple of powers of d greater than or equal to 1.\n\nBut here, the expression is 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nd divides 3d^3, -9d^2, 27d, but not necessarily 39. So, since d divides the first three terms, for d to divide the entire expression, it must divide the constant term when the other multiples are divided out, but since the expression is exactly those terms plus 39, so for d to divide 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39, it is equivalent to d dividing 39, because the first three terms are divisible by d, so their sum is divisible by d, thus the whole sum is congruent to 39 mod d.\n\nLet S = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d +39\n\nS \u2261 0 (mod d)\n\nBut since 3d^3 \u2261 0 mod d, -9d^2 \u2261 0, 27d \u2261 0, therefore S \u2261 39 \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nSo yes, d must divide 39.\n\nIs that correct? Only if d is integer, which it is.\n\nFor any integer k, if k \u2261 0 mod d, then d | k.\n\nNow, S \u2261 39 mod d, since all other terms vanish modulo d.\n\nSo indeed, S \u2261 39 (mod d), and we need S \u2261 0 (mod d), so 39 \u2261 0 (mod d), which means d | 39.\n\nOh, so n+2 divides 39.\n\nIs that it? That seems straightforward. But let me verify.\n\nIf d | 39, and since S = P(d) is exactly the expression, and we have that if d | 39, then d | S, because S \u2261 39 \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nBut is that sufficient? In this case, since the other terms are divisible by d, yes, if d divides 39, it certainly divides the entire S.\n\nBut let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose n=1, then d=3, 39/3=13, integer, so should work.\n\nCompute P(d): for n=1, expression is 3(1+3)(1+9)=3*4*10=120\n\nn+2=3, 120/3=40, integer, yes.\n\nBut according to d|39, d=3|39, yes.\n\nNow another one, n=7, d=9, 39/9 is not integer, so shouldn't work.\n\nExpression: 3(7+3)(49+9)=3*10*58=1740, divided by 7+2=9, 1740 / 9 = 193.333? 9*193=1737, 1740-1737=3, not divisible. Indeed.\n\nBut d|39, and d\u22653, so possible divisors of 39 are the positive divisors: 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut d\u22653, and n positive integer, so d\u22653, so d=1 is excluded.\n\nd=1 would be n+2=1, n=-1, not positive, so only 3,13,39.\n\nd=3: n=1\n\nd=13: n=11\n\nd=39: n=37\n\nNow check each.\n\nn=1: as above, 3(4)(1+9)=3*4*10=120, divided by n+2=3, 120/3=40, integer.\n\nn=11: expression 3(11+3)(121+9)=3*14*130\n\n14*130=1820, times 3=5460\n\nn+2=13, 5460 / 13.\n\n13*420=5460? 13*400=5200, 13*20=260, total 5460, yes.\n\nn=37: 3(37+3)(37^2 +9)=3*40*(1369+9)=120*1378\n\n37^2=1369, yes, +9=1378.\n\n120*1378.\n\nBut divided by n+2=39.\n\nSince d|39 should work, but let me verify.\n\n120*1378 / 39.\n\nFirst, 120/3=40, 39/3=13, better to compute directly.\n\n39 * ? \n\nNote that 1378 / 2 = 689, but perhaps calculate.\n\nSince we know it should divide, but for sake of verification.\n\n120 / 3 = 40, and 1378 / 13? 13*106=1378? 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, total 1378, yes. So 1378 / 13 = 106, so overall (120 * 1378) / (39) = 120 * 106 / 3 = 40 * 106 = 4240, integer. Good.\n\nBut the problem asks for sum of all such positive integers, so by this, n=1,11,37, sum is 1+11=12, +37=49.\n\nBut is that all? Earlier I thought d must divide 39, but is this necessary and sufficient?\n\nIn my derivation, I assumed that since the polynomial modulo d is 39, so d|39 implies d|S.\n\nBut is this correct for all d? What if d divides the leading coefficients or something? But in this case, since we are dealing with integers, and d is integer, and S is integer, and S \u2261 39 mod d, so yes, if d|39, then d|S.\n\nBut is the converse true? If d|S, then d|39? From S \u2261 39 mod d, if d|S, yes, S\u22610, so 0\u226139 mod d, so d|39.\n\nSo actually, d must divide 39.\n\nBut are there no other possibilities? What if d is a divisor that shares factors with other parts? But according to this, no, because modulo d, only 39 matters.\n\nIn the polynomial, when I say S \u2261 39 mod d, that's correct as long as d divides each term that has d as a factor, which is true for all integer d \u22600, which it is.\n\nBut what if d=0? But d=n+2\u22653>0, so no problem.\n\nBut let me see, is there any n where d does not divide 39 but still divides the expression? Suppose d divides S but not 39. From congruence, it's impossible because S - 39 is divisible by d, since S - 39 = 3d^3 -9d^2 +27d, which is clearly divisible by d, so S \u2261 39 mod d, so if d|S, then d|39. So yes, necessary and sufficient.\n\nBut in my earlier example, with n=7, d=9, S=1740 for the expression? Earlier I computed for n=7, expression was 3*10*58=1740, d=9, 1740 /9 = 193.333? 9*193=1737, 1740-1737=3, not zero, so 1740 \u2261 3 mod 9, while 39\u22613 mod 9, same. So S \u2261 39 \u22613 mod 9, not 0, so not divisible.\n\nNow, but 39 has divisors 1,3,13,39, all covered, and we have n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"sum of all positive integers n\", and I have three values, sum 49.\n\nI recall that in the expression, there is a 3, and n+2, and perhaps for some n, n+2 could divide even if not dividing 39, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother way to look: perhaps I can write the expression as quotient when divided by n+2.\n\nSince n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9), and n^2+9 = (n^2 -4) +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13? Let me see.\n\nPerform polynomial division.\n\nConsider the expression f(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)\n\nWe want to divide by n+2.\n\nSet t = n+2, so n = t-2.\n\nThen f(t-2) = 3((t-2)+3)((t-2)^2 +9) = 3(t+1)(t^2 -4t +4 +9) = 3(t+1)(t^2 -4t +13)\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, since t divides f(t-2), which is a polynomial in t.\n\nf(t-2) = 3(t+1)(t^2-4t+13)\n\nNow, for integer t\u22653, this is divisible by t iff t divides this expression.\n\nExpanding, we have 3[t^3 -4t^2 +13t + t^2 -4t +13] = 3[t^3 -3t^2 +9t +13]\n\nSo 3t^3 -9t^2 +27t +39\n\nThen dividing by t: (3t^3 -9t^2 +27t +39)/t = 3t^2 -9t +27 + 39/t\n\nFor this to be an integer, 39/t must be integer, so t must divide 39.\n\nHence, t = n+2 must be a positive divisor of 39, and since n\u22651, t\u22653, so divisors are 3,13,39 as before.\n\nSo n=1,11,37, sum=1+11+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"find the sum\", and it seems straightforward, but let me see if there are more.\n\nWhat about negative divisors? But d=n+2\u22653>0, so negative divisors won't give positive n, since if d negative, n<-2<0, not positive integer.\n\nSo only positive divisors.\n\nDivisors of 39 are \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139, but positive and n positive, so only 3,13,39.\n\nBut is 39 correct? n=37, which is fine.\n\nBut let me check n=37 again.\n\nExpression: n+3=40, n^2+9=37^2+9=1369+9=1378\n\nProduct: 40*1378=55120? No:\n\n3(n+3)(n^2+9)=3*40*1378\n\n40*1378=55120, times 3=165360\n\nNow divided by n+2=39.\n\n165360 / 39.\n\n39*4240=39*4000=156000, 39*240=9360, total 156000+9360=165360, yes, exactly 4240, so yes.\n\nSimilarly others work.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\", and I have sum 49, but let me see if I missed any divisor.\n\nWhat about d=1? But d=n+2=1, n=-1, not positive.\n\nd=13, n=11.\n\nd=3,n=1.\n\nd=39,n=37.\n\nIs there d=39's other divisors? Like 1, but no.\n\n39 is 1,3,13,39, only these positive.\n\nBut what about if d divides the expression but is not a divisor of 39? But we saw that it must.\n\nPerhaps when the quadratic or something reduces, but in this algebraic derivation, it seems strict.\n\nNote that n^2+9 could be related.\n\nSince n+2 divides the expression, and expression is 3(n+3)(n^2+9), and n+2 is coprime to n+3? gcd(n+2,n+3)=gcd(n+2,1)=1, yes, since consecutive integers.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(n+2, n^2+9). Well, n^2+9 = n^2 -4 +13 = (n-2)(n+2) +13? Earlier.\n\nn^2 +9 divided by n+2: n^2 -4 +13 = (n-2)(n+2) + 13? (n-2)(n+2)=n^2-4, so yes, n^2+9 = (n^2-4) +13 = (n-2)(n+2) + 13.\n\nSo when dividing n^2+9 by n+2, quotient n-2, remainder 13.\n\nSimilarly, n+3 divided by n+2 is 1 with remainder 1? n+3 = (n+2) +1, yes.\n\nBut the expression is 3(n+3)(n^2+9).\n\nSince n+2 divides the product, and n+2 is coprime to n+3 (because gcd(n+2,n+3)=1 as consecutive integers), so n+2 must divide 3(n^2+9)? No.\n\nIn general, if a divides b*c and a coprime to b, then a divides c.\n\nHere, we have n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2+9), and since gcd(n+2, n+3)=1, so n+2 must divide 3(n^2+9)? Is that correct?\n\na divides k*b, and gcd(a,b)=1, then a/k? No.\n\nMore carefully: if gcd(a,b)=1 and a divides b*c, then a divides c.\n\nBut here, it's a divides k*b*c, where k=3, b=n+3, c=n^2+9.\n\nSo, first, since gcd(a,b)=1, and a divides k*b*c, but k is constant.\n\nAs sets, since gcd(a,b)=1, and a | k b c, then a must divide k c, because a and b coprime, so a divides k c.\n\nIs that true?\n\nFor example, suppose a divides k b c, and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\nSince gcd(a,b)=1, a and b coprime, so a has no common factors with b, so all prime factors of a must divide k c.\n\nThus a divides k c.\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nHere, a = n+2, b = n+3, gcd(a,b)=1, so a must divide k c = 3 (n^2+9).\n\nSo n+2 divides 3(n^2+9).\n\nThat's simpler.\n\nI could have gone that route.\n\nSo n+2 divides 3(n^2+9).\n\nNow, n^2+9 is the same as before.\n\nSo write it as n+2 | 3n^2 + 27.\n\nNow, divide 3n^2 + 27 by n+2.\n\nPolynomial division.\n\nn+2 into 3n^2 + 0n + 27.\n\n3n^2 / n = 3n, multiply by n+2: 3n(n+2)=3n^2 + 6n\n\nSubtract: (3n^2 + 0n +27) - (3n^2 +6n) = -6n +27\n\nNow, -6n / n = -6, multiply by n+2: -6(n+2)= -6n -12\n\nSubtract: (-6n +27) - (-6n -12) = 27 +12=39\n\nSo remainder 39.\n\nThus 3n^2 + 27 = (n+2)(3n -6) + 39\n\nFrom above, quotient is 3n -6? When I divided, first step 3n, then -6, so quotient 3n-6.\n\nCheck: (n+2)(3n-6) = n*3n +n*(-6) +2*3n +2*(-6)=3n^2-6n+6n-12=3n^2-12, not matching.\n\nI think I messed up.\n\nDividing 3n^2 + 0n +27 by n+2.\n\nBring down: 3n^2 / n = 3n\n\nMultiply 3n by (n+2): 3n * n = 3n^2, 3n*2=6n, so 3n^2 + 6n\n\nSubtract from original: (3n^2 + 0n +27) - (3n^2 +6n) = 0 -6n +27\n\nSo -6n +27\n\nNow, -6n / n = -6\n\nMultiply -6 by (n+2): -6n -12\n\nSubtract: (-6n +27) - (-6n -12) = -6n +27 +6n +12 = 39\n\nSo yes, quotient is 3n -6? The quotient is 3n from first step and -6 from second, so overall 3n -6.\n\nNow check: (n+2)(3n-6) = n*3n + n*(-6) +2*3n +2*(-6)=3n^2 -6n +6n -12=3n^2 -12\n\nBut we have to add remainder 39, so 3n^2 -12 +39 = 3n^2 +27, yes.\n\nSo 3(n^2+9) = 3n^2 +27 = (n+2)(3n-6) + 39\n\nTherefore, for n+2 to divide 3(n^2+9), since it equals (n+2) times something plus 39, so the remainder is 39, so indeed, n+2 must divide 39.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no other possibilities.\n\nBut in the original expression, there was also (n+3), but since we used the coprimality, we handled it.\n\nIn this case, we got the same condition.\n\nSo why did we have the extra factor? Actually, in our earlier derivation, we had the whole expression, but now we see that the condition is the same as n+2 dividing 3(n^2+9), since the coprimality ensured that the other factor doesn't affect.\n\nBut anyway, we have confirmed that n+2 must divide 39.\n\nSo possible n+2 = \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139.\n\nSince n positive integer, n+2 \u22653, so positive divisors: 3,13,39.\n\nCorresponding n:1,11,37.\n\nSum:1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut the problem is probably expecting a box with the answer, but let me see if I missed something.\n\nWhat about n+2=39, we did, but is there a divisor like 1? But n not positive.\n\nOr perhaps if n+2 is larger, but 39's divisors are only these.\n\nOr perhaps negative divisors, but n would be negative.\n\nUnless n is positive but n+2 negative? But n\u22651, n+2\u22653>0.\n\nPerhaps when 3(n^2+9) is divisible by higher powers, but no, because the remainder is fixed.\n\nSuppose n+2 divides 39, obviously it works.\n\nIs there any n where even if n+2 does not divide 39, still it divides the original expression? But from derivation, no.\n\nFor example, let n=2, d=4.\n\nExpression: 3(2+3)(4+9)=3*5*13=195\n\n195 / (2+2)=195/4=48.75, not integer.\n\n39 mod 4 is 3, since 39\u00f74=9*4=36, remainder 3, while 195\u00f74=48*4=192, remainder 3, same.\n\nNot zero.\n\nn=10, d=12.\n\nExpression:3(13)(100+9)=3*13*109=13*327=4251? 3*13=39, 39*109.\n\n39*100=3900, 39*9=351, total 4251.\n\nd=12, 4251 / 12=354.25? 12*354=12*300=3600, 12*54=648, total 4248, 4251-4248=3, not divisible.\n\n39 mod 12: 39-3*12=39-36=3, same remainder.\n\nNow, what if n+2 divides 39, but we missed a divisor? 39 is 3*13, so divisors only 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut perhaps d=1 is considered, but n=-1 not positive.\n\nOr d=39, n=37.\n\nBut let me compute sum: 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut I recall that in the beginning, I thought about the original expression having (n+3), and perhaps when n+3 is multiple, but no, since we considered the division.\n\nAnother thought: when n+2 divides the expression, but in the expansion, if d is large, but still.\n\nFor example, suppose d=39, we have it.\n\nSuppose d=117? Which is 3*39, but 117 does not divide 39, so according to our condition, no.\n\nn=115, d=117.\n\nThen expression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9)=3(118)(115^2 +9)=3*118*(13225+9)=3*118*13234\n\nNow, divided by 117.\n\n117=9*13, while 118 is next to 117, etc., but compute modulo 117.\n\nSince we know from algebra that S \u226139 mod d, and for d=117>39, 39 not divisible by 117, since 39<117, so not zero modulo 117.\n\nTo confirm, compute S mod 117.\n\nBut easier to see that since d>39 and d does not divide 39, and S \u226139 \u22600 mod d, so doesn't divide.\n\nNumerically: but large numbers, but anyway.\n\nSo only when d|39.\n\nBut d=39 works, d=1 does not give positive n, but is there d=13,3,39 only.\n\nBut what about d=0? But d=n+2\u22653>0.\n\nOr if n+2=39/k for k dividing, but n integer.\n\nAnother way: since n+2 | 39, so n+2 is a divisor of 39, so all positive divisors are 1,3,13,39, and n\u22651 so n+2\u22653, so exclude 1, so n+2=3,13,39, n=1,11,37, sum=1+11+37=49.\n\nSum is 49.\n\nBut I recall that sometimes problems might include when the divisor is larger, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps when n+2 is not coprime to something, but in our derivation using the gcd, we handled that case.\n\nIn the gcd approach, we said since gcd(n+2, n+3)=1, so n+2 must divide 3(n^2+9).\n\nBut is this always true? What if n+2 shares a common factor with the constant or something, but no, because we established that a divides k c given condition.\n\nBut specifically, in this case, since gcd(n+2,n+3)=1, yes.\n\nBut what if n+2 is even, or something, but still, since coprime to n+3, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, n=1, gcd(1+2,1+3)=gcd(3,4)=1, yes.\n\nn=11, gcd(13,14)=1.\n\nn=37, gcd(39,40)=1.\n\nAll good.\n\nSuppose n+2 and n+3 not coprime? But they are always coprime since consecutive integers.\n\nAlways gcd is 1, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are n=1,11,37.\n\nSum is 1+11=12, 12+37=49.\n\nBut let me see the answer, or think if there is any other possibility.\n\nWhen I computed the division, I got remainder 39, but in the original expression, it was 3(n+3)(n^2+9), and we simplified to n+2 dividing 3(n^2+9) with remainder 39, so yes.\n\nBut actually, in the original, there is (n+3), which we handled by coprimality.\n\nInstead of using coprimality, I could write the entire expression modulo n+2.\n\nSet n \u2261 -2 mod (n+2)\n\nThen the expression: 3(n+3)(n^2+9) \u2261 3(-2+3)((-2)^2 +9) = 3(1)(4+9)=3*1*13=39 mod (n+2)\n\nBecause when n\u2261-2, n+3\u22611, n^2+9\u2261(-2)^2 +9=4+9=13.\n\nSo indeed, the expression is congruent to 39 modulo n+2.\n\nTherefore, for it to be 0 modulo n+2, we need 39 \u22610 mod (n+2), i.e., n+2 | 39.\n\nSame conclusion.\n\nSo definitely, only these three values.\n\nSum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows n=0? But it says positive integers, so n\u22651, so n=0 not included.\n\nn+2=3, n=1, which is positive.\n\nIf n=0, d=2, expression 3(3)(0+9)=3*3*9=81, 81/2=40.5 not integer, and 39 not divisible by 2, so not.\n\nSimilarly, negative n not considered.\n\nSo, I think sum is 49.\n\nBut let me confirm the sum: 1 + 11 = 12, 12 + 37.\n\n37 + 12 = 49, yes.\n\n1+37=38, 38+11=49.\n\nSo, answer should be 49.\n\nBut I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes multiple roots or something, but here it's straightforward.\n\nPerhaps when d=13, n=11, we have it.\n\nOr d=3, n=1.\n\nBut is there a case where n+2 is a divisor but we forgot? Like d=39 itself.\n\nBut sum is less than 50, so probably correct.\n\nPerhaps the expression could be zero, but for n positive, it's positive, so no issue.\n\nOr if n+3=0, n=-3, not positive.\n\nn^2+9=0 no real solutions.\n\nSo, no.\n\nThus, I think it's correct.\n\nSo the sum is 49.\n"

        "Okay, let's see. I need to find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\). Hmm, divisibility problem. Let me start by understanding what it's asking for. So, \\( n + 2 \\) should be a divisor of that product. Maybe I can rewrite the equation to find some relationship?\n\nSo, the condition is \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\). Which means there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) = k(n + 2) \\). Maybe I should arrange this equation to have all terms on one side and factor?\n\nAlternatively, since \\( n + 2 \\) divides that product, perhaps I can express \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\) in terms of \\( n + 2 \\). Let me try to manipulate the expression \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\) modulo \\( n + 2 \\).\n\nIf I recall, if \\( n + 2 \\) divides a number, then that number modulo \\( n + 2 \\) should be zero. So maybe substituting \\( n = -2 \\) into \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 + 9) \\) gives me something?\n\nLet me try that. Substitute \\( n = -2 \\):\n\n\\( 3(-2 +3)((-2)^2 +9) = 3(1)(4 +9) = 3*1*13 = 39 \\). Wait, but when \\( n = -2 \\), substituting into \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\), it's 39. So the remainder is 39 when divided by \\( n + 2 \\), which would be 0 in that case? But that can't be because if \\( n = -2 \\), then \\( n +2 = 0 \\), division by zero is undefined, so I must have done something wrong here.\n\nMaybe my approach is okay, but \\( n \\) is positive integer, so maybe starting at 1. Let me think again.\n\nSince \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( n + 2 \\geq 3 \\). The problem wants \\( n +2 \\) divides that product, which we can write as:\n\n\\( n + 2 \\, | \\, 3(n +3)(n^2 +9) \\).\n\nMaybe performing polynomial division of \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\) by \\( n + 2 \\)? Or perhaps factoring?\n\nLet me try to expand \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\). Let's see:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( (n +3)(n^2 +9) \\):\n\n\\( (n +3)(n^2 +9) = n^3 + 3n^2 +9n +27 \\).\n\nThen multiply by 3: \\( 3n^3 +9n^2 +27n +81 \\).\n\nBut maybe expanding isn't helpful here. Alternatively, note that since \\( n +2 \\) divides the expression, then \\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\equiv 0 \\mod (n +2) \\).\n\nSo using modular arithmetic here. Let me compute each component modulo \\( n + 2 \\).\n\nLetting \\( m = n + 2 \\), so \\( n = m -2 \\). Then:\n\n\\( 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \\equiv 3(m -2 +3)( (m -2)^2 +9 ) \\mod m \\).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n\\( m -2 + 3 = m +1 \\).\n\n\\( (m -2)^2 +9 = m^2 -4m +4 +9 = m^2 -4m +13 \\).\n\nSo the expression becomes \\( 3(m +1)(m^2 -4m +13) \\mod m \\).\n\nBut since modulo m, as m \u2261 0 mod m. So:\n\n\\( 3(m +1)(m^2 -4m +13) \\equiv 3(0 +1)(0 -0 +13) = 3*1*13 = 39 \\mod m \\).\n\nSo, 39 \u2261 0 mod m. Therefore, m divides 39. But m = n + 2. Since n is positive, m is at least 3. The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since m \u2265 3, m can be 3, 13, 39.\n\nTherefore, in terms of n, n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39, so n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nTherefore, the positive integers n are 1, 11, 37. Sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify each case.\n\nFirst, take n =1. Check if 1 + 2 =3 divides 3*(1+3)(1 +9) =3*4*10=120. Then 3 divides 120? Yes, since 120/3=40. So yes.\n\nn=11: n +2=13. Check if 13 divides 3*(11+3)(11^2 +9)=3*(14)*(121+9)=3*14*130=3*14*130. 14*130=1820. 3*1820=5460. 5460 divided by 13: Let me compute 13*420=5460. So yes, 13 divides 5460.\n\nn=37: n +2=39. Check if 39 divides 3*(37+3)(37^2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)= 3*40*1378. Compute 3*40=120, 120*1378. Let's see 120*1378. 100*1378=137800, 20*1378=27560, total 137800+27560=165360. Check if 39 divides 165,360. 39*4240=165,360. So yes, dividing 165360 /39. 39 into 165: 4*39=156, remainder 9. 93 divided by 39=2 (78), remainder 15. 156 divided by 39=4. Let me confirm 39*4240: 39*4000=156000, 39*240=9360. 156000+9360=165360. Perfect. That divides.\n\nSo divisors are indeed 1,11,37, sum 49. Wait, but wait hold on. The divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39, but in terms of m =n +2, m must be divisor of 39. So m is among 3,13,39? Because n is positive integer, so n +2 must be at least 3. But if we check m=3, then n=1; m=13, n=11; m=39,n=37. So those seem to be all.\n\nBut wait hold on. When I did the substitution, I set m =n +2, and found that for 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) \u2261 39 mod m, so 39 \u2261 0 mod m, so m divides 39. Therefore m is positive divisors of 39, and since m >=3 because n >=1, so possible m=3,13,39 indeed. Thus n=1,11,37. Then sum is 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nWait, but maybe the original 3(n+3)(n^2 +9) ?\n\nBut but I thought there are other divisors. Let me think again if correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are cases where n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n ^2 + 9), but not necessarily directly requiring that it divides 39. For example, perhaps when there are common factors between n +2 and, say, (n +3) or the rest?\n\nWait, the approach I took was substituting n = m -2 into the expression and finding that modulo m (i.e., n+2), the result is 39. Therefore, m must divide 39. Therefore, m is a divisor of 39, so m=1,3,13,39, but m >=3, so n+2=3,13,39. Hence n=1,11,37. The only way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that reasoning skips some possible cases because maybe n+2 could share a common factor with the expression's other parts?\n\nWait, let me check. For example, suppose that while n+2 divides 3(n+3)(n^2 +9), but perhaps factors between n+2 and some of those terms could allow for some more possible n's?\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let's analyze that. Let's denote d = n +2, so n = d -2.\n\nThen the expression is 3(n +3)(n^2 +9) = 3(d -2 +3)( (d -2)^2 +9 )=3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13). So it is factorized as 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13). Therefore, d divides the product 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13). But d divides this, meaning that d divides 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13).\n\nAlternatively, notice that d must divide 39. Since we have:\n\nSince d | 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13). Since d divides this product, which is equal to 3*(d+1)*(d^2 -4d +13). Then as d divides this product, and we have:\n\nBecause d and d+1 are coprime, since consecutive integers, they share no common factors. Similarly, d and d^2 -4d +13. Let's see if d divides into d^2 -4d +13.\n\nCompute d^2 -4d +13 = d(d -4) +13. So d divides into d(d -4), so the remainder when dividing d^2 -4d +13 by d is 13. Therefore, d divides 3*(d+1)*13. Because since d divides 3(d +1)* (d^2 -4d +13) but (d, d +1) =1 and (d, d^2 -4d +13) = (d,13). So the expression 3(d+1)(d^2 -4d +13) is divisible by d, so since d divides 3*(d+1)*(d^2 -4d +13}, and because d and d +1 are coprime, d must divide 3* (d^2 -4d +13). Then since d divides 3* (d^2 -4d +13}, and as we saw earlier, d divides into 3*13, because when d^2 -4d +13 is divided by d, the remainder is 13. Therefore, that term contributes a 13 mod d, and multiplied by 3 gives remainder 3*13=39. Therefore, d divides 39. Hence again, m=d divides divisors of 39. Therefore, same conclusion.\n\nSo the key here is to recognize via substitution that unless there's a shared factor, but due to coprime factors, m needs to divide 39. Therefore, concluding valid n are 1,11,37 sum 49.\n\nBut just to make sure there isn't another case where m divides into the product due to coinciding factors: suppose d divides 3 and (n+3)*something. For example, even if d is not a divisor of 3*13, but factors align. But given the step-by-step division, mod m = d gives 39\u22610 mod d, I think it's solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "Okay, so I need to find the sum of all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding the problem more clearly. The question is asking for all positive integers n where n + 2 is a divisor of 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, after finding all such n, I need to sum them up and provide the result.\n\nFirst, let me paraphrase the condition. If n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), that means when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, the remainder should be zero. In other words, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is a multiple of n + 2. So perhaps I can express this as a division statement and look at the remainder. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to factor or rearrange the expression to make this divisibility more apparent.\n\nLet me try to use polynomials. Sometimes when you have expressions like a polynomial divided by a linear term (n + 2), you can apply the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem says that if a polynomial P(n) is divided by (n - a), the remainder is P(a). Wait, in this case, the divisor is (n + 2), which is equivalent to (n - (-2)). So if I let P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), then dividing P(n) by (n + 2) gives a remainder equal to P(-2). If this remainder is zero, then (n + 2) divides P(n). However, since we're talking about divisors, even if the remainder isn't zero, the division might still result in an integer if there's a factor in the numerator that cancels out denominators. But since n is an integer, perhaps the remainder must be zero. Wait, but maybe I'm oversimplifying here.\n\nWait, let me check. The question is in integers, not polynomials. So we have n as a positive integer, and n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So in other words, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divisible by n + 2. This is equivalent to saying that (3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9)) / (n + 2) is an integer. So maybe I can write this quotient as an integer and try to find for which n this happens.\n\nAlternatively, since n + 2 is a divisor, then we know that n + 2 must divide any integer linear combination of these terms. Hmm, so maybe I can consider the remainder when 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divided by n + 2.\n\nLet me compute P(n) = 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute P(n) divided by (n + 2). Using the Remainder Theorem, the remainder is P(-2). Let's compute P(-2):\n\nP(-2) = 3*(-2 + 3)*(-2\u00b2 + 9) = 3*(1)*(4 + 9) = 3*1*13 = 39.\n\nSo according to the Remainder Theorem, when 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divided by n + 2, the remainder is 39. So in order for n + 2 to divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), it must be that n + 2 divides the remainder 39. Wait, hold on. The statement is that if the remainder is 39, then we need n + 2 to divide 39. Let me verify.\n\nIn polynomial division terms, P(n) = Q(n)*(n + 2) + remainder. The remainder is a constant when dividing by a linear term, so that would be 39. Therefore, for integral divisibility, since Q(n) is an integer when n is an integer, then (n + 2) must divide 39. Therefore, possible divisors of 39 (positive and negative) give possible values of n + 2.\n\nBut the problem states that n is a positive integer. Therefore, n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 39 greater than 2 (since n is positive, n + 2 \u2265 3). Let's list the positive divisors of 39:\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n \u22651), then possible values for n + 2 are 3, 13, 39, which correspond to n = 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the positive integers n are 1, 11, 37. Therefore, their sum would be 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. So is that it?\n\nWait, wait a second. Hold on. Let me check again. So if n + 2 divides 39, then n + 2 could be any of the divisors of 39, including negative ones. But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3, so only the positive divisors 3, 13, 39. So yep, n would be 1, 11, 37.\n\nBut wait, let me test these n's to ensure that they indeed satisfy the original condition. Sometimes, such problems can have subtleties where even if the divisor divides the remainder, because we're dealing with an expression that has more terms, maybe there's cancellation, but in this case, according to the Remainder Theorem approach, if n + 2 divides the remainder 39, then when you divide P(n) by (n + 2), Q(n) is an integer polynomial, so Q(n) plus 39 divided by (n + 2) equals the original expression over (n + 2). Therefore, for this to be an integer, the remainder must be divisible by (n + 2). Therefore, yes, n + 2 must divide 39.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Let me take a concrete example. Let me check n =1:\n\nFor n =1, compute 3*(1 + 3)*(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*(1 + 9)= 3*4*10 = 120. Now, n + 2 =3. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is integer. So okay, n=1 works.\n\nn =11:\n\n3*(11+3)*(11\u00b2 +9) =3*14*(121 +9)= 3*14*130. Let's compute 14*130 first: 14*130 = 1820. Then 3*1820=5460. Then, n +2=13. 5460 \u00f713. Let's check 13*420=5460. So yes, integer. So 13 divides 5460, so okay.\n\nn=37:\n\n3*(37 +3)*(37\u00b2 +9). Let's compute step by step. 37+3=40, 37\u00b2=1369, so 1369 +9=1378. Then the product is 3*40*(1378). 3*40=120, so 120*1378. Let's compute 120*1378. 1378*100=137,800; 1378*20=27,560. Total is 137,800 +27,560=165,360. n +2=39. So 165,360 \u00f739. Let me compute 39*4240=39*(4000 +240)=39*4000=156,000; 39*240=9,360; so total 156,000 +9,360=165,360. So yes, 4240*39=165,360. So divides easily. So n=37 also works.\n\nWait, so the logic so far suggests that the possible n are 1, 11, 37, and therefore sum is 49. But that seems straightforward, but the problem says \"Find the sum of all positive integers n.\" So is that all?\n\nBut just to be safe, let's see if maybe there are any more divisors. For example, is it possible that n +2 could be a divisor of 39, without P(n)/(n +2) being an integer? Like, maybe in some cases, even though n +2 doesn't divide 39, the division still results in integer?\n\nWait a minute, my approach is based on that to have (n +2) divides P(n), since P(n) = (n +2)*Q(n) + 39. Therefore, if (n +2) divides P(n), 39 must be congruent to 0 mod (n +2). Therefore, (n +2) divides 39.\n\nBut since 39 can be both positive or negative divisors, but being n positive integer, (n +2) is at least 3, so just the positive divisors of 39 which are 3,13,39 as before.\n\nTherefore, yes, only n=1,11,37. However, let me confirm that for another candidate. Suppose n +2 has common factors with 3 or something else in the expression, but if n is a positive integer and (n +2) is 3,13,39, we checked those. Maybe if we have more divisors? Wait, 39 is 3*13, so its divisors are 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut for n +2 less than or equal to 39, which for n positive, is possible. Wait, 39 +2 is 41? No, n +2 is 39, so n=37, which is within positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, could there be some factorization trick here where even if n +2 doesn't divide 39, some factors inside P(n) over n +2 can produce an integer for some n's? Maybe we can rewrite the expression 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factorizing (n\u00b2 +9). Wait, we know that n\u00b2 +9 can be expressed as (n + 3i)(n - 3i), but complex numbers are not going to help here. Alternatively, could there be some polynomial identity? Let's try another approach.\n\nLet me attempt to express 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) in terms of (n +2). Let\u2019s perform polynomial division. But perhaps it's time consuming.\n\nAlternatively, set variable m = n + 2. Then, n = m -2. Let's rewrite the expression 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) in terms of m:\n\nCompute n +3 = m -2 +3 = m +1.\n\nn\u00b2 +9 = (m -2)\u00b2 +9 = m\u00b2 -4m +4 +9 = m\u00b2 -4m +13.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13).\n\nSo which is 3*(m +1)*(m\u00b2 -4m +13).\n\nSo the original expression is 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13). Now, dividing by m (since n + 2 = m), so the original problem's expression is 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13) divided by m. So 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13)/m must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, m must divide 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13).\n\nSince m and 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13)/m must be integers, so m must be a positive integer divisor of 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13). So m divides this product. However, m divides into 3(m +1)(m\u00b2 -4m +13). Since m and m +1 are coprime (consecutive integers), so m must divide 3*(m\u00b2 -4m +13). Therefore, m divides 3(m\u00b2 -4m +13). Let's write this as an equation:\n\nm | 3(m\u00b2 -4m +13). Therefore, m divides 3*13 = 39. Because:\n\nLet me define the expression m divides 3(m\u00b2 -4m +13). Let me write this as 3(m\u00b2 -4m +13) mod m must be 0. Compute 3(m\u00b2 -4m +13) mod m. Since m\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod m, -4m \u2261 0 mod m, and 13 is 13 mod m. So m divides 3*(0 - 0 +13) = 39. So m must divide 39, and since n is positive, m = n +2 \u22653. So m is 3,13,39, leading to n =1,11,37 as before.\n\nTherefore, seems the conclusion is correct: n =1,11,37, sum 49. Therefore, final answer is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, after finding all such n, I have to sum them up. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I get it: find all n \u2208 \u2115\u207a where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, mathematically, we can write this as n + 2 | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). That is, when we divide 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) by n + 2, there is no remainder. \n\nHmm, division with factors. I remember such problems often require using the divisibility properties or perhaps polynomial division. Let me recall that if d divides a product, then d must divide the product of the terms, but since d is n + 2 in this case, which is a linear term, maybe I can express the entire product in terms related to n + 2 somehow. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Remainder Theorem? For polynomial division, the remainder when dividing by (n + 2) would be equal to substituting n = -2 into the polynomial. Let's test that idea.\n\nWhat is 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 + 9) evaluated at n = -2? Let me calculate that first.\n\nBut wait, actually, if we write this as a polynomial in n, let's first expand the product. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand (n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9):\n\nMultiply (n + 3) with (n\u00b2 + 9): n*(n\u00b2 + 9) + 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) = n\u00b3 + 9n + 3n\u00b2 + 27. So combine like terms:\n\nn\u00b3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27. Then multiply by 3 to obtain:\n\n3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81.\n\nSo now, the expression is 3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n + 81. Let's check if that's correct. Wait, 3*(n\u00b3 + 3n\u00b2 + 9n + 27) is indeed 3n\u00b3 + 9n\u00b2 + 27n +81. Alright.\n\nNow, since we are dealing with divisibility by n + 2, substituting n = -2 into the polynomial 3n\u00b3 +9n\u00b2 +27n +81 gives us the remainder when dividing by n + 2.\n\nCalculating remainder: 3*(-2)^3 +9*(-2)^2 +27*(-2) +81.\n\nSo that's 3*(-8) +9*(4) +27*(-2) +81. Let me compute each term:\n\n3*(-8) = -24\n\n9*4 = 36\n\n27*(-2) = -54\n\n81 remains 81.\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n-24 +36 = 12\n\n12 + (-54) = -42\n\n-42 +81 = 39.\n\nSo the remainder is 39. Hence, when you divide 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) by n + 2, the remainder is 39. Therefore, n +2 divides this expression if and only if n +2 divides 39.\n\nBecause the remainder is 39, so in order for n +2 to divide the whole expression, n +2 must be a divisor of 39. That is, n +2 | 39.\n\nSo n +2 is a positive integer divisor of 39, since n is a positive integer. Therefore, the divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut since n +2 has to be at least 3 (since n is a positive integer, n \u22651, so n +2 \u2265 3) or wait, wait. Wait n is a positive integer, so n must be 1 or more. Therefore, n + 2 is 3 or more. So but the divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n +2 can't be 1 (as n would be negative), possible divisors are 3,13,39.\n\nTherefore, solving n +2 = each divisor:\n\nCase 1: n +2 = 3 \u21d2 n = 1\n\nCase 2: n +2 = 13 \u21d2 n =11\n\nCase3:n +2=39 \u21d2n=37\n\nSo the positive integers n are 1,11,37.\n\nThus, their sum is 1 +11 +37 = 49.\n\nWait, is this correct? Let me double-check.\n\nSo, according to this logic, since n +2 must divide 39 (the remainder when divided by n +2 is 39. So in order for (n +2) to divide the original expression, which would leave the original expression = k*(n +2) + 0, so for that the remainder, 39 must be a multiple of (n+2). So yes, that implies (n +2) is a divisor of 39. Since n+2 \u22653, the divisors are 3,13,39,\n\nn:1,11,37.\n\nBut let's check for these candidates separately, just to be thorough.\n\nStart with n =1:\n\nCheck if 1 +2=3 divides 3*(1 +3)(1\u00b2 +9)=3*4*10=120. 3 divides 120? Yes, since 120/3=40, so yes, remainder is 0. Correct.\n\nNext, n=11:11+2=13, check if 13 divides 3*(11+3)*(11\u00b2 +9)=3*14*(121 +9)=3*14*130=3*14*130. Let me compute 3*14=42; 42*130=5460. 5460 \u00f713. Let's compute: 13*420=5460 (420*10=4200, 420*3=1260; add to get 4200+1260=5460). So yes, 13 divides 5460. Therefore, correct.\n\nNow n=37:37+2=39.\n\nCheck if 39 divides 3*(37+3)*(37\u00b2 +9).\n\nFirst, compute 37+3=40, 37\u00b2=1369, so 1369 +9=1378.\n\nHence, the product is 3*40*1378=120*1378.\n\nFirst, compute 1378*100=137,800; 1378*20=27,560. So total 137,800 +27,560=165,360.\n\nSo 3*40 is 120. Wait, 3*(40)*(1378) = 120*1378=165,360.\n\nNow 165,360 \u00f739=?\n\nCompute 39*4240: 4240*40=169,600. That's too high.\n\nWait. Let's divide 165,360 \u00f739:\n\n39 into 165: 4*39=156. 165 -156=9.\n\nBring down the 3: 93. 39*2=78. 93-78=15.\n\nBring down the 6: 156.\n\n39*4=156. 156-156=0. Bring down 0. So we've got 42[ ] . Wait, first part:\n\nWait, 39 ) 165,360. Step by step:\n\n39 into 165, 4 times 39 is 156. Subtract from 165: 9. Bring down 3 \u2192 93.\n\n39 into 93: 2 times, 78. Subtract: 15. Bring down 6 \u2192 156.\n\n39 into 156: 4 times 156. Subtract, you get 0. Bring down 0. 0. So the answer is 4240. \n\nSo 39 divides 165,360 exactly, since 165,360 \u00f739=4240. So yes, 39 divides 3*(37+3)(37\u00b2 +9). Therefore, correct.\n\nSo our initial candidates each satisfy the condition, so the answer is 1,11,37 sum to 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nBut before concluding, let me check if we considered all possible divisors of 39. The positive divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut as n must be positive, n +2 has to be at least 3 (since n\u22651). Therefore, possible n +2 is 3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37. So these are all indeed, which we have checked, and no others.\n\nBut hold on a second, 391 and 39? Wait, 39 is itself 39. Oh no, no, the divisors would be just positive divisors as 1,3,13,39 since 39 factors into 3 \u00d713. So correct. Yes, 39 is the highest.\n\nHence, 49 is the sum. Hence, I think the answer should be \\boxed{49}.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n",
        "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to find the sum of all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Hmmm, divisibility problems can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can figure it out. \n\nFirst, let's restate the problem in my own words. We need all positive integers n where (n + 2) is a divisor of 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then we sum all those n's. Alright. \n\nSo, the key concept here is divisibility. If n + 2 divides that product, then when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. In other words, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) modulo (n + 2) should be zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps I can use modular arithmetic here. If I take everything modulo (n + 2), that might simplify things. Let's think. When working modulo (n + 2), n is congruent to -2, right? Because n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). So, maybe I can substitute n with -2 in the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) and see what the value is modulo (n + 2). If the entire expression is congruent to 0 mod (n + 2), then n + 2 divides the product.\n\nLet me write that out. Let's compute 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) mod (n + 2). Replace each n with -2:\n\nFirst, compute n + 3: (-2) + 3 = 1 mod (n + 2).\n\nNext, compute n\u00b2 + 9: (-2)\u00b2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13 mod (n + 2).\n\nSo the entire product becomes 3 * 1 * 13 = 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, for n + 2 to divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), it must divide 39. That is, 39 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), which means that (n + 2) is a divisor of 39. \n\nAh! So, we're looking for positive integers n such that n + 2 divides 39. The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be any of these, so n would be -1, 1, 11, or 37. But since n is a positive integer, n must be 1, 11, or 37. Wait, n can't be -1. So the possible values are n=1, 11, 37. \n\nWait a second, but let me confirm. Divisors of 39 can be positive or negative? Because if n + 2 is a divisor of 39, but n must be a positive integer. Let me recall: The problem says n is a positive integer, so n + 2 must be a positive integer greater than 2. So negative divisors of 39 would lead to n + 2 negative, which would make n negative, which contradicts the positive integer requirement. So we can ignore the negative divisors. \n\nTherefore, the correct possible values of n + 2 are the positive divisors of 39. The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39 as before. Hence, n + 2 = 1 gives n = -1 (invalid), 3 gives n =1, 13 gives n=11, 39 gives n=37. Therefore, the positive integer solutions are 1, 11, 37. \n\nNow, we're told to sum these up. 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. So the answer is 49. \n\nBut wait, before I conclude, I need to make sure that all these n's actually work. Let me check each one.\n\nFirst, take n=1:\n\nn + 2 = 3. Then the product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1^2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Then check if 3 divides 120. 120 \u00f7 3 = 40. Yes, it works.\n\nn=11:\n\nn +2 =13. The product is 3*(11 +3)*(11\u00b2 + 9)= 3*14*(121 +9)= 3*14*130. Let's compute this: 3*14=42, and 42*130=5460. Now divide 5460 by 13: 13*420=5460. So yes, 13 divides 5460.\n\nn=37:\n\nn +2 = 39. The product is 3*(37+3)*(37\u00b2 +9) =3 *40*(1369 +9) = 3*40*1378. Let's compute this: 3*40=120, so 120*1378. That's 120*1378 = 165,360. Now divide 165,360 by 39. Let's check: 39*4000=156,000. 165,360 -156,000= 9,360. 39*240=9,360. So 4000 +240=4240. So 39*4240=165,360. Yes, so 39 divides 165,360. So n=37 also works.\n\nSo all three values work. Therefore, their sum is 1 +11 +37=49. So the answer is 49.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me check if there are other divisors. 39 is prime factors 3*13. So the divisors are 1,3,13,39. So unless I missed something, that's all, right? So no, cannot be a composite divisor beyond those.\n\nSo another way to think: Heuristically, maybe there are other methods. But given that substituting n \u2261-2 into the product gives 39, and thus n+2 must divide 39, the solution seems comprehensive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could use polynomial division. Let's try dividing 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) by (n +2) and see if the remainder becomes 39. Then, if you perform polynomial division, the remainder when divided by (n +2) is indeed the same as evaluating the polynomial at n = -2, by the remainder theorem. Which we already did, so the remainder is 39. So in order for (n +2) to divide 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9), we need (n +2) divides 39, hence the logic follows.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) is \\boxed{49}.\n",
        "Alright, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and then sum all those n. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In divisibility terms, this means when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there's no remainder. So mathematically, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). I think another way to think about this is that n + 2 has to be a divisor of the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9).\n\nSo maybe I can find some expression f(n) such that f(n) is divisible by n + 2. Maybe using polynomial division or looking for a remainder? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let me substitute k = n + 2. Then n = k - 2. Let's substitute this into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9).\n\nSo, substituting n = k - 2:\n\nFirst, n + 3 becomes (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1.\n\nn\u00b2 + 9 becomes (k - 2)\u00b2 + 9 = k\u00b2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k\u00b2 - 4k + 13.\n\nTherefore, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) becomes 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13).\n\nAlso, since n + 2 = k, we need k to divide 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). So, k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). So, we need 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 0 mod k. Which is equivalent to the remainder being zero when 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) is divided by k.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) modulo k. Let's see.\n\nBut when we calculate modulo k, any term with a factor of k is congruent to 0. So simplify each part:\n\n3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) mod k:\n\nFirst, k + 1 mod k is 1. Similarly, k\u00b2 - 4k + 13 mod k is (0 - 0 + 13) =13. So, each term becomes:\n\n3 * 1 * 13 mod k. So 39 mod k. That means that 39 \u2261 0 mod k. Therefore, k must divide 39.\n\nWait, this is a key insight!\n\nSo in other words, since we do 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) \u2261 3*1*13 \u2261 39 mod k, so 39 must be congruent to 0 mod k; so k divides 39.\n\nTherefore, all positive integers k such that k divides 39 law, which are the positive divisors of 39.\n\nWhat's the divisors of 39? Let's see: 1, 3, 13, 39.\n\nBut wait, k is n + 2, which must be a positive integer (since n is positive integer). So n is a positive integer, k = n + 2, so k = 3,4,...? Wait, if n is at least 1, then k is at least 3. So k is in {3,4,...}\n\nBut the divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39. So possible k values are 3,13,39 because 1 is less than 3, which may not be possible since n \u22651 implies k\u22653.\n\nWait, hold on. n is a positive integer, so n \u22651. Then k = n + 2 \u22653. Therefore, possible k values are 3,13,39.\n\nSo then the corresponding n would be k - 2. Thus:\n\nIf k =3, n =1\n\nk=13, n=11\n\nk=39, n=37\n\nHence possible solutions are n=1,11,37.\n\nWait, is that all?\n\nBut let's check based on the logic above. If k divides 39, then k can be 1,3,13,39.\n\nBut since k must be at least 3 (n \u22651), so 3,13,39.\n\nTherefore, n=1,11,37.\n\nBut before I conclude, let me check each possible n.\n\nFirst, test n=1.\n\nCheck if 1 +2 =3 divides 3*(1 +3)*(1\u00b2 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120 divided by 3 is 40. So yes, 3 divides 120. Okay.\n\nSecond, check n=11. So n+2=13. Check if 13 divides 3*(14)*(121 +9)=3*14*130=3*14*130. Let me calculate: 14*130=1820, then 3*1820=5460. Divide by 13: 5460 divided by13. 13*420=5460. So yes, 13 divides 5460.\n\nThird, n=37. n+2=39. Then check if 39 divides 3*(40)*(37\u00b2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378. Let's compute 40*1378=55,120. Then 3*55,120=165,360. Now, 165,360 divided by39. Since 39=13*3. Let's divide 165,360 by13 first: 13*12720=165, 360. Therefore, yes, 13*12720=165,360. So 39 divides 165,360.\n\nSo all three values work.\n\nAlternatively, I might be missing some other k...\n\nWait a second, is there a case when k>39 and divides 39? Well, 39 divides itself, and then any multiple of 39. But if k is a positive divisor greater than 39?  Let me see. If k divides 39, then  its prime factors are 3 and13. The divisors are as before. So  ones larger than39 would be when some multiple of 39, but in the positive divisors there isn't, because 39 factors are limited. So divisors are positive integers that divide 39, which is 1,3,13,39.\n\nHence, there are no divisors of 39 larger than 39. Thus only 3,13,39 as allowed.\n\nTherefore, we might think that there are three solutions. But before finalizing this, hold on, did we cover all possible k.\n\nWait. When we simplified 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) modulo k. Let's check when we substitute k into that expression, we get it's congruent to 39 mod k. Hence, implies k divides 39. Therefore only the divisors of 39. So yeah, the logic there seems sound.\n\nAlternatively, could there be any mistake in assuming only that? Let me test another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we need n+2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's check it as:\n\nLet D = n+2.\n\nThen, D divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). So, similar to before, but perhaps by manipulating the expression.\n\nBut if I prefer staying in terms of n, maybe use Euclidean algorithm or check for remainder.\n\nAnother way: Since n + 2 divides this expression, let's evaluate the expression when divided by n+2.\n\nDivide 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) by n +2.\n\nAlternatively, divide each term.\n\nAlternatively, substitute n= -2 into the polynomial: Wait here, if n +2 divides the polynomial P(n) =3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9), then P(-2) should be \u2261 0 mod (n +2). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall the factor theorem: If (n - a) divides P(n), then P(a) =0. But here, a = -2. Wait, but in the expression, the variable is n, and the divisor is (n +2). So according to factor theorem, since (n - (-2)) is a divisor, then P(-2)=0. But let's compute.\n\nCalculate P(-2): n=-2.\n\nSo it's 3*(-2 +3)*((-2)^2 +9)=3*(1)*(4 + 9)=3*1*13=39. So indeed, if (n +2) divides P(n), then P(-2) \u22610 mod (n +2). In this case, P(-2)=39, so 39 \u22610 mod (n +2). Therefore, n +2 divides 39, again the same conclusion. Therefore, n +2 must be a positive divisor of 39.\n\nTherefore, the same results. So since n is positive, n +2 must be a positive divisor of 39 greater than or equal to 3. The divisors are 3,13,39, so n=1,11,37. So the answer is 1+11+37=49.\n\nWait, so no other possible n. Therefore, sum is 1 + 11 +37=49.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 49.\n\nBut wait, solving similar problems sometimes requires checking more possibilities. Let me check for other possible k.\n\nBut all the divisors of 39 are 1, 3,13,39. Since n+2 must be at least 3, only the 3,13,39 are considered so three n's:1,11,37.\n\nBut perhaps n +2 can be a positive divisor or negative divisor, but since n is a positive integer, n+2 must be  positive. So yeah.\n\nAlternatively, let's check again for the factor theorem alternative.\n\nSuppose (n +2) divides the product 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then n \u2261-2 mod (n +2). So evaluating the product at n=-2:\n\nWhich gives: 3(-2 +3)((-2)^2 +9)=3(1)(4 +9)=3*1*13=39. Thus, 39 \u22610 mod(n +2). That implies that (n +2) divides 39.\n\nHence, n +2 must be one of the divisors of 39, namely \u00b11,\u00b13,\u00b113,\u00b139. But since n is positive integer, we take positive divisors:1,3,13,39, then excluding n+2=1 as n would negative.\n\nTherefore, n+2=3,13,39, each gives n=1,11,37. Hence, sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nAlternatively, is divisible different? Could there be a case where even though n+2 doesn't divide 39, but divides the original product? For example, if the remainder is zero regardless?\n\nBut according to the two different methods: evaluating at n=-2 and substituting k=n+2, conclusion is n +2 divides 39.\n\nHence, the sum should be 49. Let me just confirm once with n=3. If someone thought n=3 could be a solution. Let's say n=3 (k=5). Then check n+2=5 divides 3*(6)*(9 +9)=3*6*18=324. 324 divided by5 is 64.8, so no. Not an integer. So that would be failure.\n\nTherefore, correct answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}\n"

        "Okay, so I have this problem: Find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this. \n\nFirst, the problem is asking for all positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n + 2 \\) is a divisor of \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). Then, I need to find the sum of all such \\( n \\). Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nSo, \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). That means when we divide \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\) by \\( n + 2 \\), there's no remainder. In mathematical terms, \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\equiv 0 \\mod (n + 2) \\). So, if I can find all \\( n \\) such that this congruence holds, that should give me the solutions.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( k = n + 2 \\). That way, \\( n = k - 2 \\), and maybe this substitution will simplify the expression. Let's see:\n\nSubstituting \\( n = k - 2 \\) into the expression \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\), we get:\n\nFirst, \\( n + 3 = (k - 2) + 3 = k + 1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( n^2 + 9 = (k - 2)^2 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 4 + 9 = k^2 - 4k + 13 \\).\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). And we need \\( k \\) to divide this product. Wait, but \\( k = n + 2 \\), so \\( k \\) is a positive integer greater than 2, since \\( n \\) is a positive integer. So \\( k \\) is at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all positive integers \\( k \\geq 3 \\) such that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). Then, once I find those \\( k \\), I can convert back to \\( n \\) by subtracting 2, and sum them up.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let me think. Since \\( k \\) divides the product \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\), we can say that \\( k \\) must divide each factor, or at least one of the factors. But since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Similarly, \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\) might have some common factors. Let's check.\n\nFirst, check if \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1) \\). Since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide 3. So possible values of \\( k \\) here are 1 or 3. But since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), only \\( k = 3 \\) is possible. So if \\( k = 3 \\), then \\( n = 1 \\). Let's check if \\( n = 1 \\) works. Let's compute \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\), and the product is \\( 3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3(4)(10) = 120 \\). 120 divided by 3 is 40, so yes, 3 divides 120. So \\( n = 1 \\) is a solution. So that gives us one solution so far.\n\nNext, check if \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\). Let's write this as \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\). That simplifies to \\( -4k + 13 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\), which is equivalent to \\( -4k \\equiv -13 \\mod k \\). Dividing both sides by k (since we're in modulo k), we get \\( -4 \\equiv -13/k \\mod 1 \\). Wait, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\), so \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( -4k + 13 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\), so \\( -4k \\equiv -13 \\mod k \\). Simplifying, divide both sides by k: \\( -4 \\equiv -13/k \\mod 1 \\). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let's compute \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\) modulo \\( k \\):\n\n\\( k^2 \\mod k = 0 \\), so \\( -4k + 13 \\mod k = (-4k \\mod k) + 13 \\mod k = 0 + 13 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\equiv 13 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\) implies that \\( k \\) divides 13. Because \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\equiv 13 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must divide 13. Since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), the possible values of \\( k \\) are 13 (since 13 is prime). So \\( k = 13 \\), which gives \\( n = 13 - 2 = 11 \\). Let's check if \\( n = 11 \\) works.\n\nCompute \\( 11 + 2 = 13 \\), and the product \\( 3(11 + 3)(11^2 + 9) = 3(14)(121 + 9) = 3(14)(130) = 3*14*130. Let's compute 14*130 first: 14*100=1400, 14*30=420, so total 1400 + 420 = 1820. Then 3*1820 = 5460. Now divide 5460 by 13: 5460 \u00f7 13. Let's compute 13*400 = 5200, so 5460 - 5200 = 260. 260 \u00f713 = 20. So total 400 + 20 = 420. So yes, 13 divides 5460. Therefore, \\( n = 11 \\) is a solution. So that's another solution.\n\nSo far, we have \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 11 \\). Wait, but maybe there are more solutions? Because maybe \\( k \\) divides 3 as well? Let me check.\n\nWe considered that \\( k \\) divides 3, leading to \\( k = 1, 3 \\), but only \\( k = 3 \\) is valid. Then, we considered \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\), leading to \\( k = 13 \\). But maybe there are other factors? Wait, but \\( k \\) could divide the entire product \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). So, even if \\( k \\) doesn't divide any individual factor, as long as it divides the product, then \\( k \\) is a solution. So perhaps we need to check if there are other \\( k \\) values where \\( k \\) divides the entire product.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( k \\) divides the product, \\( k \\) must share a common factor with at least one of the factors in the product. But since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, and \\( k \\) and \\( 3 \\) could share a common factor. Wait, but we already considered \\( k \\) divides 3, leading to \\( k = 3 \\). What about \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\)? We found that \\( k \\) must divide 13, leading to \\( k = 13 \\). So maybe those are the only possibilities? But let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a case where \\( k \\) divides the entire product but doesn't divide any of the individual factors. For example, if \\( k \\) shares a common factor with both \\( 3(k + 1) \\) and \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\). But since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) can't have a common factor with both \\( 3(k + 1) \\) and \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\). Because if \\( k \\) shares a factor with \\( k^2 - 4k + 13 \\), then it must be a factor of 13 as we saw earlier. So perhaps the only possibilities are \\( k = 3 \\), \\( k = 13 \\), and maybe others?\n\nWait, but let's see. Let me test some small values of \\( k \\). Since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), let's check \\( k = 3 \\), \\( k = 4 \\), \\( k = 5 \\), etc.\n\nFor \\( k = 3 \\): 3 divides 3*(4)*(9 - 12 + 13) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 \u00f73 = 40, so yes.\n\nFor \\( k = 4 \\): 4 divides 3*(5)*(16 - 16 + 13) = 3*5*13 = 195. 195 \u00f74 = 48.75, which is not an integer. So 4 does not divide 195. So \\( k = 4 \\) is not a solution.\n\nFor \\( k = 5 \\): 5 divides 3*(6)*(25 - 20 + 13) = 3*6*18 = 324. 324 \u00f75 = 64.8, not integer.

Not a solution.\n\nFor \\( k = 7 \\): 7 divides 3*(8)*(49 - 28 + 13) = 3*8*34 = 816. 816 \u00f77 = 116.571..., not integer. Not a solution.\n\nFor \\( k = 8 \\): 8 divides 3*(9)*(64 - 32 + 13) = 3*9*45 = 1215. 1215 \u00f78 = 151.875, not integer. Not a solution.\n\nFor \\( k = 9 \\): 9 divides 3*(10)*(81 - 36 + 13) = 3*10*58 = 1740. 1740 \u00f79 = 193.333..., not integer. Not a solution.\n\nFor \\( k = 10 \\): 10 divides 3*(11)*(100 - 40 + 13) = 3*11*73 = 2409. 2409 \u00f710 = 240.9, not integer. Not a solution.\n\nFor \\( k = 11 \\): 11 divides 3*(12)*(121 - 44 + 13) = 3*12*90 = 3240. 3240 \u00f711 = 294.545..., not integer. Wait, but earlier when \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 11 \\). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, \\( k = 13 \\), which gives \\( n = 11 \\). Let's check \\( k = 13 \\):\n\n3*(14)*(169 - 52 + 13) = 3*14*130 = 5460. 5460 \u00f713 = 420, which is integer. So that works. So \\( n = 11 \\) is a solution. So maybe \\( k = 13 \\) is the next solution. So in the earlier test for \\( k = 11 \\), which is \\( n = 9 \\), we saw that 11 didn't divide 3240. Wait, 3240 \u00f711 is indeed 294.545..., which is not integer. So \\( k = 11 \\) isn't a solution. Hmm.\n\nWait, so maybe only \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( k = 13 \\) are solutions. Let me check \\( k = 13 \\), as we did, works. Let me check another prime, like \\( k = 17 \\), maybe? Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, \\( k \\) must divide 13 or 3. Since 13 is prime, and 3 is prime, so the only possible \\( k \\) values are 3 and 13. Let me check \\( k = 13 \\), works. What about \\( k = 21 \\)? If \\( k = 21 \\), then \\( n = 19 \\). Let's check if 21 divides the product.\n\nCompute \\( 3*(22)*(441 - 84 + 13) = 3*22*370 = 24*370 = 8880. 8880 \u00f721. 21*400 = 8400, 8880 - 8400 = 480. 480 \u00f721 \u224822.857. Not integer. So 21 does not divide 8880. So \\( k = 21 \\) is not a solution.\n\nSimilarly, \\( k = 13 \\) works. Let me check \\( k = 3 \\), which gives \\( n = 1 \\). So maybe those are the only solutions. But wait, let's check \\( k = 1 \\). But \\( k = 1 \\) corresponds to \\( n = -1 \\), which is not positive. So that's invalid. So the only possible solutions are \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( k = 13 \\), leading to \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 11 \\). Then, the sum is \\( 1 + 11 = 12 \\).\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, let me make sure there aren't other solutions. Let me think again. The original problem is \\( n + 2 \\) divides \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\). So, when \\( n = 1 \\), we have \\( 3 \\) divides \\( 3*4*10 = 120 \\), which is true. When \\( n = 11 \\), \\( 13 \\) divides \\( 3*14*130 = 5460 \\), which is true. Are there any other \\( n \\) where \\( n + 2 \\) divides this product?\n\nLet me check \\( n = 3 \\). Then, \\( n + 2 = 5 \\). Compute the product: \\( 3*(6)*(9 + 9) = 3*6*18 = 324 \\). 324 divided by 5 is 64.8, not integer. So no.\n\n\\( n = 5 \\): \\( n + 2 = 7 \\). Product: \\( 3*8*(25 + 9) = 3*8*34 = 816 \\). 816 \u00f77 \u2248116.571, not integer.\n\n\\( n = 7 \\): \\( n + 2 = 9 \\). Product: \\( 3*10*(49 + 9) = 3*10*58 = 1740 \\). 1740 \u00f79 \u2248193.333, not integer.\n\n\\( n = 9 \\): \\( n + 2 = 11 \\). Product: \\( 3*12*(81 + 9) = 3*12*90 = 3240 \\). 3240 \u00f711 \u2248294.545, not integer.\n\n\\( n = 13 \\): \\( n + 2 = 15 \\). Product: \\( 3*16*(169 + 9) = 3*16*178 = 8208 \\). 8208 \u00f715 = 547.2, not integer.\n\n\\( n = 15 \\): \\( n + 2 = 17 \\). Product: \\( 3*18*(225 + 9) = 3*18*234 = 12, 3*18=54, 54*234=12,672. 12,672 \u00f717 \u2248745.411, not integer.\n\n\\( n = 17 \\): \\( n + 2 = 19 \\). Product: \\( 3*20*(289 + 9) = 3*20*298 = 17,880. 17,880 \u00f719 \u2248941.052, not integer.\n\nHmm, so none of these work. Maybe there are only two solutions: \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 11 \\). Let me check \\( n = 19 \\), \\( k = 21 \\). Wait, we checked \\( k = 21 \\) earlier, no. How about \\( n = 7 \\), \\( k = 9 \\). Wait, already checked. So seems like only two solutions. \n\nBut let me think again about the substitution. We set \\( k = n + 2 \\), so \\( k \\geq 3 \\). Then, we have \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). Since \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1) \\), then \\( k \\) must divide 3, leading to \\( k = 3 \\). Then, \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 - 4k +13 \\), leading to \\( k \\) divides 13, so \\( k =13 \\). Therefore, only two solutions. Hence, the sum is \\( 1 + 11 = 12 \\). \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose \\( k \\) divides the entire product \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\). Then, \\( k \\) must divide at least one of the factors. But since \\( k \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide 3 or \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\). So, that's exactly what we did. Therefore, only \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( k =13 \\). Hence, only two solutions. \n\nBut let me verify once more with \\( k = 13 \\). The expression is \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\). For \\( k =13 \\), that's \\( 3*14*(169 -52 +13) = 3*14*130 = 5460 \\). 5460 divided by 13 is 420, which is exact. So yes, 13 divides 5460. So that works. \n\nAnother way to think about this problem is to use modular arithmetic. Since \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\), then \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\). Let's compute this modulo \\( k \\):\n\nFirst, \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\), so \\( k^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\). Then, \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\equiv -4k +13 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( 3(k +1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\equiv 3(k +1)(-4k +13) \\mod k \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\), so \\( -4k \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( -4k +13 \\equiv 13 \\mod k \\). So, \\( 3(k +1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\equiv 3(k +1)(13) \\mod k \\). So, the entire expression reduces to \\( 39(k +1) \\mod k \\). So, \\( 39(k +1) \\equiv 0 \\mod k \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) divides \\( 39(k +1) \\).\n\nSince \\( k \\) and \\( k +1 \\) are coprime, \\( k \\) must divide 39. Therefore, \\( k \\) divides 39. Since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), the possible \\( k \\) values are 3, 13, and 39. \n\nWait, this is a different approach. So earlier, we considered that \\( k \\) divides 3 or 13, but this approach says \\( k \\) divides 39. So, the divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since \\( k \\geq 3 \\), the possible \\( k \\) are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, these are the possible solutions. Therefore, \\( k = 3 \\), 13, 39. Therefore, corresponding \\( n \\) are 1, 11, 37. Wait, but 39 is a possible \\( k \\), so \\( n = 39 - 2 = 37 \\). Let me check if \\( n = 37 \\) is a solution.\n\nCompute \\( n + 2 = 39 \\). The product is \\( 3(37 + 3)(37^2 + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378 \\). Let's compute step by step. First, 3*40 = 120. Then, 120*1378. Let's compute 120*1000 = 120,000; 120*300 = 36,000; 120*70 = 8,400; 120*8 = 960. So total is 120,000 + 36,000 = 156,000; 156,000 +8,400=164,400; 164,400 +960=165,360. So the product is 165,360. Now divide by 39: 165,360 \u00f739. Let's compute 39*4000 = 156,000. 165,360 -156,000 =9,360. 39*240=9,360. So total is 4000 +240=4240. So 39 divides 165,360. Therefore, \\( n = 37 \\) is a solution. \n\nSo, we missed this solution earlier. So why did we miss it? Because in our previous approach, when we considered \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k + 1) \\) or \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\), we concluded \\( k =3 \\) or \\( k=13 \\). But in reality, \\( k \\) could also divide the entire product, which in this case, led us to consider \\( k \\) divides 39. So perhaps we need to combine both approaches.\n\nSo, the correct way is to note that \\( k \\) divides \\( 3(k +1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\), so \\( k \\) must divide 39(k +1), since \\( k \\) and \\( k +1 \\) are coprime, so \\( k \\) divides 39. Therefore, possible \\( k \\) values are 3,13,39. Therefore, \\( n =1,11,37 \\). Then, sum is 1 +11 +37=49. Wait, so this is different from our previous conclusion. So where did we go wrong earlier?\n\nEarlier, when I substituted \\( k = n +2 \\), and considered that \\( k \\) divides 3(k +1) or \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\), but in reality, \\( k \\) can divide the entire product \\( 3(k +1)(k^2 -4k +13) \\), which is a more general case. So, the correct approach is to note that since \\( k \\) divides the product, and \\( k \\) is coprime with \\( k +1 \\), then \\( k \\) must divide 39. Therefore, \\( k \\) divides 39, leading to \\( k =3,13,39 \\). Therefore, \\( n =1,11,37 \\). Therefore, the answer should be 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nWait, but in my initial substitution, I considered that \\( k \\) divides 3(k +1) or \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\), but that approach missed the possibility where \\( k \\) shares a common factor with both 3 and \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\). But since 3 and \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) are coprime? Wait, not necessarily. Let's check. For example, when \\( k =3 \\), \\( k^2 -4k +13 =9 -12 +13=10, which is coprime with 3. When \\( k =13 \\), \\( k^2 -4k +13=169 -52 +13=130, which is coprime with 3. When \\( k =39 \\), \\( k^2 -4k +13=1521 -156 +13=1378. 1378 \u00f73=459.333... So 1378 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 and \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\) are coprime. So, in this case, since \\( k \\) divides 39, which factors into 3*13, and \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 39. Therefore, possible \\( k \\) are 3,13,39. Therefore, three solutions. Therefore, the sum is 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nBut why did we not get this in the initial approach? Because when we considered \\( k \\) divides 3(k +1) or \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\), we concluded \\( k =3 \\) or \\( k=13 \\), but missed \\( k=39 \\). The reason is that when \\( k=39 \\), \\( k \\) divides the entire product, but \\( k \\) doesn't divide any individual factor. So, in that case, \\( k=39 \\) divides 3(k +1)(k^2 -4k +13) because 39 divides 39(k +1). Since \\( k +1 =40 \\), which is 40. 39 divides 39*40, so yes, 39 divides the entire product. So, this is a case where \\( k \\) divides the product, but doesn't divide any individual factor. Therefore, the initial approach missed this case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 49. So, the sum is 1 +11 +37=49.\n\nBut let me verify once again with \\( k=39 \\). Let's compute the product:\n\n\\( 3(n +3)(n^2 +9) \\) where \\( n=37 \\). So, \\( n +3=40 \\), \\( n^2 +9=1369 +9=1378 \\). So, the product is \\( 3*40*1378 \\). Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, 3*40=120. Then, 120*1378. Let's compute 120*1000=120,000; 120*300=36,000; 120*70=8,400; 120*8=960. So, 120,000 +36,000=156,000; 156,000 +8,400=164,400; 164,400 +960=165,360. Now, 165,360 divided by 39: 39*4000=156,000. 165,360 -156,000=9,360. 39*240=9,360. So total is 4000 +240=4240. So, 165,360 \u00f739=4240, which is exact. Therefore, 39 divides the product. Therefore, \\( n=37 \\) is indeed a solution.\n\nTherefore, the three solutions are \\( n=1,11,37 \\), summing to 49.\n\nSo, why did the initial approach miss this? Because when I considered that \\( k \\) divides either 3(k +1) or \\( k^2 -4k +13 \\), but \\( k=39 \\) doesn't divide 3(k +1) because \\( k +1=40 \\), so 39 and 40 are coprime. Also, \\( k=39 \\) doesn't divide \\( k^2 -4k +13=1378 \\), since 1378 \u00f739: 39*35=1365, 1378-1365=13, so remainder 13. Therefore, \\( k=39 \\) doesn't divide either individual factor but divides the entire product. Therefore, the correct approach is to note that \\( k \\) must divide 39(k +1), hence \\( k \\) divides 39. Therefore, leading to three solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}",
        "Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n where n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum those n's. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's restate the problem. We need n + 2 to be a divisor of the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). In other words, when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by (n + 2), there should be no remainder. So mathematically, this means that (n + 2) divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), which we can write as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nOr equivalently,\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nSince we're working modulo (n + 2), we can substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2). Wait, but n is a positive integer, so n + 2 is a positive integer greater than 2. Hmm, maybe substitution is a good approach here.\n\nLet me try substituting n = -2 into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's see:\n\nIf n = -2, then:\n\n3(-2 + 3)( (-2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(1)(4 + 9) = 3(1)(13) = 39\n\nSo when n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), which is the same as n \u2261 -2 mod k where k = n + 2, the expression becomes 39. Therefore, the original expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 39 mod k. For k to divide this expression, 39 must be \u2261 0 mod k. But k is n + 2, which is a positive integer greater than 2 (since n is positive). Therefore, k must be a divisor of 39.\n\nSo, n + 2 divides 39, and n + 2 is a positive integer greater than 2. So the divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1, n + 2 \u2265 3). Therefore, possible divisors are 3, 13, 39. Wait, but 1 and 39 are the only ones? Wait, 39's divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So n + 2 can be 3, 13, or 39. Therefore, n can be 1, 11, or 37.\n\nBut wait, let's check if these actually satisfy the original condition. Let's test each n:\n\n1. n = 1: Check if 1 + 2 = 3 divides 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So yes, 3 divides 120. So n = 1 is valid.\n\n2. n = 11: Check if 11 + 2 = 13 divides 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute that: 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. 14*130 = 1820, 3*1820 = 5460. Now, 5460 divided by 13. Let's see: 13*400 = 5200, so 5460 - 5200 = 260. 260 divided by 13 is 20. So total is 420. Therefore, 13 divides 5460, so n = 11 is valid.\n\n3. n = 37: Check if 37 + 2 = 39 divides 3(37 + 3)(37\u00b2 + 9). Let's compute that: 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. 40*1378 = 55,120. 3*55,120 = 165,360. Now, divide 165,360 by 39. Let's see: 39*4000 = 156,000. 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360. 39*240 = 9,360. So total is 4000 + 240 = 4240. Therefore, 39 divides 165,360, so n = 37 is valid.\n\nSo all three values n = 1, 11, 37 satisfy the condition. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers n is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the sum of all positive integers n\". So, all n that satisfy the condition. So 1, 11, 37. Sum is 49. But let me check again if there could be other divisors. Wait, maybe I missed some divisors?\n\nWait, divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. So n + 2 must be among these. But n is positive, so n + 2 \u2265 3. So possible n + 2 is 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n is 1, 11, 37. So sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other possible divisors. For example, if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), but 39 is the value when n = -2. So, if we substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), then the expression is 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) must divide 39. So, indeed, the possible divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39. So n is 1, 11, 37. So sum is 49. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach where I can factor the original expression and see if n + 2 divides it. Let's try that.\n\nThe original expression is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's factor n\u00b2 + 9. That's a sum of squares, which factors as (n + 3i)(n - 3i) in complex numbers, but in integers, it doesn't factor. So, n\u00b2 + 9 is irreducible over integers. Therefore, the expression is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, since n + 2 divides this product, and n + 3 is part of the product. So, n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Since n + 2 and n + 3 are two consecutive integers (since (n + 3) - (n + 2) = 1), they are coprime. Therefore, if n + 2 divides the product, it must divide the other factors, which are 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9). So, n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9).\n\nTherefore, if n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 is a divisor of 3, so possible n + 2 is 1 or 3. But n is positive, so n + 2 \u2265 3. Therefore, n + 2 = 3, so n = 1. That's one solution.\n\nAlternatively, if n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Let's consider this case.\n\nSo, n + 2 divides n\u00b2 + 9. Therefore, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Again, substituting n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), so n = -2. Then, (-2)^2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13. Since 13 is prime, the divisors are 1 and 13. But n + 2 must be positive, so n + 2 = 13, so n = 11. Alternatively, n + 2 = 1, but that would give n = -1, which is not positive. Therefore, n = 11.\n\nWait, but in this case, n + 2 must divide 13, so possible n + 2 is 1 or 13. So n = 11 is valid, but n = -1 is invalid. Therefore, only n = 11.\n\nTherefore, combining both cases: n + 2 divides 3 gives n = 1, and n + 2 divides 13 gives n = 11, and n = 37? Wait, where did n = 37 come from?\n\nWait, in the first approach, we considered that n + 2 divides 39. In the second approach, we split into two cases: n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). When n + 2 divides 3, we get n = 1. When n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), we found n = 11. But where is n = 37?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a third case where n + 2 divides (n + 3)? But n + 2 and n + 3 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, if n + 2 divides (n + 3), then n + 2 divides 1, which is impossible since n + 2 is at least 3. So that case is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the first approach, when substituting n = -2, we found that 39 must be divisible by n + 2, so n + 2 divides 39, which gives n + 2 = 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. But in the second approach, splitting into cases, we only found n = 1 and n = 11. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let's check again.\n\nOriginal problem: n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, in the second approach, we considered that since n + 2 and n + 3 are coprime, then n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, we split into two cases: n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). \n\nIf n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 is 1 or 3, but n is positive, so n + 2 = 3, n = 1.\n\nIf n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), then n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Substituting n = -2, we get 13 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2), so n + 2 divides 13. Therefore, n + 2 = 1 or 13. But n is positive, so n + 2 = 13, n = 11.\n\nBut in the first approach, we considered that when substituting n = -2, the expression becomes 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, so there's a conflict here. Why is there a third solution in the first method but not the second?\n\nAh, because in the second approach, we only considered that n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). But in reality, the original expression is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and n + 2 is coprime to n + 3 (since they are consecutive integers), then n + 2 must divide 3(n\u00b2 + 9). So, in the second approach, we split into two cases: n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). But perhaps there's a third case where n + 2 divides both 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9). But since n + 2 divides 3, it must be a divisor of 3, which as before, only gives n + 2 = 3. Then, in the case where n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), but n + 2 is already a divisor of 3, so in that case, n + 2 divides gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9). But n + 2 divides 3 and divides (n\u00b2 + 9). If n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 is 1 or 3. If n + 2 divides both 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 must divide gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9). But n\u00b2 + 9 is congruent to 0 mod (n + 2). So, if n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 is 1 or 3. Let's check n + 2 = 3. Then, n = 1. Then, n\u00b2 + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10. So, gcd(3, 10) = 1. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3 and 10, which would require n + 2 divides 1, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no overlap. Therefore, the two cases are exhaustive: either n + 2 divides 3, leading to n = 1, or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), leading to n = 11. But where does n = 37 come from?\n\nWait, so in the first approach, substituting n = -2 gives 39, so n + 2 divides 39. Therefore, possible divisors 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. But in the second approach, splitting into cases, we only get n = 1 and n = 11. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because in the first approach, we considered that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 39 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 39. However, in the second approach, we considered that n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). So why is there a difference?\n\nWait, in the second approach, we considered that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and since n + 2 is coprime to n + 3, then n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). But in the first approach, we substituted n = -2 into the original expression, which is equivalent to evaluating the expression modulo (n + 2). So, in reality, the two approaches are equivalent. So why is the first approach suggesting a third solution?\n\nWait, let's check n = 37. Let's verify if n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So n = 37, n + 2 = 39. 3(n + 3) = 3*40 = 120. n\u00b2 + 9 = 37\u00b2 + 9 = 1369 + 9 = 1378. So 120 * 1378 = 120*1378. Let's compute that. 120*1000 = 120,000. 120*300 = 36,000. 120*70 = 8,400. 120*8 = 960. So total is 120,000 + 36,000 = 156,000 + 8,400 = 164,400 + 960 = 165,360. So 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 165,360. Now, 165,360 divided by 39. Let's compute 39*4000 = 156,000. 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360. 39*240 = 9,360. So total is 4000 + 240 = 4240. Therefore, 39 divides 165,360, so yes, n = 37 is valid.\n\nBut why didn't the second approach catch this? Because in the second approach, we considered that n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's check if 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) when n = 37. So n = 37, n\u00b2 + 9 = 1378. 3*1378 = 4134. 4134 divided by 39. Let's compute 39*100 = 3900. 4134 - 3900 = 234. 39*6 = 234. So total is 100 + 6 = 106. So 39 divides 4134, which is 3*1378. Therefore, n + 2 = 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). So why in the second approach, when n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), we only found n = 11? Wait, because when n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), we set n = -2 mod (n + 2), so n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13, leading to n + 2 = 1 or 13. But n = 37, n + 2 = 39, which divides 39. But 39 is not a divisor of 13. So, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, so the problem is that in the second approach, we considered that n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), which led us to n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). But in the case where n = 37, n + 2 = 39, which divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Wait, but 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). But 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) implies that 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Because 39 = 3*13, so if 39 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9), then 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). So, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod 13. Let's check n = 37. 37 mod 13 is 37 - 2*13 = 37 - 26 = 11. So n \u2261 11 mod 13. Then, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 11\u00b2 + 9 = 121 + 9 = 130. 130 mod 13: 13*10 = 130, so 130 \u2261 0 mod 13. Therefore, yes, 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, in the second approach, when considering n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), we split into two cases: n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). But n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9) would require that n + 2 divides 13 (as per the first approach) or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Wait, perhaps in the second approach, when we substituted n = -2, we found that n + 2 divides 13. But in reality, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). So, if n + 2 divides 13, then n + 2 = 1 or 13, leading to n = -1 or 11. But if n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), but 3 and 13 are coprime, then n + 2 must divide 3 or 13. But if n + 2 divides 13, then n + 2 = 1 or 13. If n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 = 1 or 3. So combining these, possible n + 2 is 1, 3, 13. But n is positive, so n + 2 = 3, 13, leading to n = 1, 11. But in the case of n = 37, n + 2 = 39, which is 3*13. So, 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) because 39 divides 3*13*(something). Wait, but n + 2 = 39, which divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Let's check 3(n\u00b2 + 9) when n = 37.\n\nn = 37: 3(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3*(37\u00b2 + 9) = 3*(1369 + 9) = 3*1378. 1378 is 3*459. Therefore, 3*1378 = 3*3*459 = 9*459. 459 is 3*153. So 9*459 = 9*3*153 = 27*153. 153 is 9*17. So 27*153 = 27*9*17 = 243*17. Therefore, 3(n\u00b2 + 9) = 243*17. Now, n + 2 = 39 = 3*13. So, 39 divides 243*17. Since 39 divides 243*17, but 39 and 17 are coprime, so 39 must divide 243. 243 divided by 39 is 6.28... Wait, but 39*6 = 234, which is less than 243. 243 - 234 = 9. So 243 = 39*6 + 9. Therefore, 39 does not divide 243. Wait, but 243 = 3^5, and 39 = 3*13. So 39 divides 243 only if 13 divides 243. But 243 divided by 13 is 18.69... So 13 does not divide 243. Therefore, 39 does not divide 243*17. Wait, but earlier calculation said that 3(n\u00b2 + 9) when n = 37 is 165,360, which is divisible by 39. But 165,360 divided by 39 is 4240. Wait, but according to factorization, 3(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3*37\u00b2 + 27 = 3*1369 + 27 = 4107 + 27 = 4134. Wait, but 3*1378 is 4134. 4134 divided by 39 is 106. Because 39*100 = 3900, 4134 - 3900 = 234, which is 39*6. So 100 + 6 = 106. So 39 divides 4134. But 4134 = 3*1378. So, 39 divides 3*1378. But 39 = 3*13, so 3*13 divides 3*1378. Therefore, 13 divides 1378. Let's check: 13*100 = 1300, 1378 - 1300 = 78. 13*6 = 78. So total is 100 + 6 = 106. So 13 divides 1378. Therefore, 39 divides 3*1378. Therefore, even though 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), the substitution approach gives that n + 2 divides 39, which includes 3, 13, 39. So, in this case, n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. But why in the substitution approach, we found that n + 2 divides 39, but in the case of n = 37, n + 2 = 39, which divides 39, but in the second approach, when considering n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), we found that n + 2 divides 13, leading to n = 11. So why isn't n = 37 considered here?\n\nAh, because when n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), as per substitution, we get n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13. Therefore, possible (n + 2) is 1 or 13. But in reality, n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), so if n + 2 divides 39, then even if (n + 2) divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9), it's possible that n + 2 is a divisor of 39 that isn't a divisor of 13. Wait, but 39's divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So, in the case of n + 2 = 39, which divides 39, but 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). However, 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) implies that 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Because 39 = 3*13, so 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Then, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod 13. Let's check n = 37. 37 mod 13 is 11. 11\u00b2 + 9 = 121 + 9 = 130. 130 mod 13 is 0. So yes, 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, n + 2 = 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) because 39 divides 3*13*(something). Therefore, even though n + 2 = 39 is a divisor of 39, which is 3*13, it's still valid because 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). So, in this case, n = 37 is valid because n + 2 = 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) since 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, even though n + 2 = 39 is not a divisor of 13, but 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) because 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, the substitution approach is more accurate because it considers the entire expression, whereas splitting into cases might miss this.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the substitution method, which gives n + 2 divides 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. Sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut let's verify n = 37 again. 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3*40*(37\u00b2 + 9). 37\u00b2 is 1369, so 1369 + 9 = 1378. 40*1378 = 55,120. 3*55,120 = 165,360. Divide by 39: 165,360 \u00f7 39. 39*4000 = 156,000. 165,360 - 156,000 = 9,360. 39*200 = 7,800. 9,360 - 7,800 = 1,560. 39*40 = 1,560. So total is 4000 + 200 + 40 = 4240. So 39*4240 = 165,360. Therefore, yes, it divides.\n\nBut why in the second approach, when considering n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), we didn't get n = 37? Because in that case, n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), which led us to n + 2 divides 13. But n + 2 = 39 divides 13*(n\u00b2 + 9)/something. Wait, but n + 2 = 39 divides (n\u00b2 + 9) if and only if 39 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). But n = 37, n\u00b2 + 9 = 1378. 1378 divided by 39: 39*35 = 1365. 1378 - 1365 = 13. So 1378 = 39*35 + 13. Therefore, 39 does not divide 1378. Therefore, n + 2 = 39 does not divide (n\u00b2 + 9). But n + 2 = 39 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). So, this is a case where n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) but does not divide (n\u00b2 + 9) itself. Therefore, in the second approach, we considered n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). But in reality, n + 2 can divide 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) even if it doesn't divide either 3 or (n\u00b2 + 9) individually, but only if it divides their product. But since 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9) are coprime (since 3 is a prime and doesn't divide n\u00b2 + 9 unless 3 divides 9, which it does, but n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod 3 implies n\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod 3, so n \u2261 0 mod 3. But n + 2 \u2261 0 mod 3 implies n \u2261 1 mod 3. Contradiction. Therefore, 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9) are coprime. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) if and only if n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, the two cases are exclusive. Therefore, how come n = 37 is a solution?\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. If n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) and 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9) are coprime, then n + 2 must divide 3 or n + 2 must divide (n\u00b2 + 9). But in the case of n = 37, n + 2 = 39. 39 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3*1378 = 4134. 39 divides 4134. But 39 does not divide 3 or 1378. Because 39 does not divide 3, and 1378 divided by 39 is 35 with a remainder of 13. Therefore, this contradicts the earlier conclusion. Therefore, my previous reasoning was flawed. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Let's see.\n\nWait, the key point is that if two numbers are coprime, then a common divisor must divide each of them. But in this case, 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9) are not necessarily coprime. Let's check if 3 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). If n is not divisible by 3, then n\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 3, so n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 1 + 0 \u2261 1 mod 3. Therefore, if n is not divisible by 3, then (n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 1 mod 3, so gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. If n \u2261 0 mod 3, then n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 + 0 \u2261 0 mod 3, so gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 3. Therefore, depending on whether n is divisible by 3 or not, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) is 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, in the case where n \u2261 0 mod 3, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 3. Therefore, if n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9), then n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). But if n \u2261 0 mod 3, then gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 3, so n + 2 could divide 3 or (n\u00b2 + 9)/3. Therefore, the case is more nuanced.\n\nTherefore, in the second approach, we need to consider different cases based on whether n is divisible by 3 or not.\n\nCase 1: n \u2261 0 mod 3. Then, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 3. So, n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) implies that n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9)/3 = n\u00b2 + 9. Therefore, n + 2 divides n\u00b2 + 9. Then, substituting n = -2 mod (n + 2), we get n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13. Therefore, n + 2 = 1 or 13. But n \u2261 0 mod 3, so n = 3k. Then, n + 2 = 3k + 2. If n + 2 = 13, then 3k + 2 = 13 => k = 11/3, which is not integer. If n + 2 = 1, then 3k + 2 = 1 => k = -1/3, invalid. Therefore, no solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: n \u2261 1 mod 3. Then, n = 3k + 1. Then, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). If n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 = 1 or 3. If n + 2 = 3, then n = 1. If n + 2 = 1, invalid. If n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), then n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Substitute n = -2 mod (n + 2), so n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13. Therefore, n + 2 = 1 or 13. n + 2 = 1 is invalid. n + 2 = 13 => n = 11. Check if n = 11 \u2261 1 mod 3. 11 mod 3 = 2, which is not 1. Wait, 11 is 3*3 + 2. So n = 11 \u2261 2 mod 3. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, no solution in this case.\n\nCase 3: n \u2261 2 mod 3. Then, n = 3k + 2. Then, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). If n + 2 divides 3, then n + 2 = 1 or 3. If n + 2 = 3, then n = 1, which is 1 mod 3, not 2 mod 3. Invalid. If n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), then n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Substitute n = -2 mod (n + 2), so n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13. Therefore, n + 2 = 1 or 13. n + 2 = 1 invalid. n + 2 = 13 => n = 11. Check if n = 11 \u2261 2 mod 3. 11 mod 3 = 2. Yes, so n = 11 is valid here.\n\nTherefore, in Case 3, n = 11 is a solution.\n\nBut where does n = 37 come from? Let's check n = 37 mod 3. 37 divided by 3 is 12*3 + 1, so 37 \u2261 1 mod 3. Therefore, n = 37 \u2261 1 mod 3. So in Case 2, n \u2261 1 mod 3, but when we considered n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), we found that n + 2 divides 13, leading to n = 11, which is \u2261 2 mod 3, contradicting. Therefore, n = 37 is not captured in this case. Therefore, this suggests that the second approach is missing something.\n\nWait, but n = 37 \u2261 1 mod 3, so in Case 2, n \u2261 1 mod 3. Then, in this case, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. Therefore, n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). If n + 2 divides 3, then n = 1, which is valid. If n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), then n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Substitute n = -2 mod (n + 2), so n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 13 mod (n + 2). Therefore, (n + 2) divides 13. Therefore, n + 2 = 1 or 13. n + 2 = 1 invalid. n + 2 = 13 => n = 11, which is \u2261 2 mod 3. Contradicts the assumption of Case 2 (n \u2261 1 mod 3). Therefore, no solutions in this case.\n\nBut n = 37 is a solution. Therefore, there must be another way that n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) even if gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. Wait, but if gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, then n + 2 must divide 3 or n + 2 must divide (n\u00b2 + 9). But n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9) implies that n + 2 divides 3 or n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, if n + 2 divides neither 3 nor (n\u00b2 + 9), but divides their product, then this would imply that n + 2 has a common factor with both 3 and (n\u00b2 + 9). But if gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, then n + 2 can't have a common factor with both. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction.\n\nBut n = 37 is a valid solution where n + 2 divides 3(n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption that gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1 when n \u2261 1 mod 3 is incorrect. Let's check n = 37. n = 37 \u2261 1 mod 3. Then, n\u00b2 + 9 = 1369 + 9 = 1378. 1378 divided by 3 is 459.333... So 1378 = 3*459. Therefore, gcd(3, 1378) = 3. Therefore, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 3 when n \u2261 1 mod 3. Wait, but earlier I thought that if n \u2261 1 mod 3, then n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 1 + 0 \u2261 1 mod 3. But 37 \u2261 1 mod 3, but 37\u00b2 + 9 = 1369 + 9 = 1378, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, my previous reasoning was flawed.\n\nWait, let's compute n\u00b2 + 9 mod 3 when n \u2261 1 mod 3. n = 3k + 1. Then, n\u00b2 = (3k + 1)^2 = 9k\u00b2 + 6k + 1. Therefore, n\u00b2 + 9 = 9k\u00b2 + 6k + 1 + 9 = 9k\u00b2 + 6k + 10. Then, modulo 3, this is 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mod 3. Therefore, n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 1 mod 3. Therefore, gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1. But in the case of n = 37, which is 1 mod 3, n\u00b2 + 9 = 1378, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, this contradicts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, 37 is 1 mod 3. 37\u00b2 = (3*12 + 1)^2 = 9*144 + 6*12 + 1 = 1296 + 72 + 1 = 1369. 1369 + 9 = 1378. 1378 divided by 3 is 459.333... Wait, no. 3*459 = 1377. 1378 - 1377 = 1. Therefore, 1378 \u2261 1 mod 3. Therefore, gcd(3, 1378) = 1. Therefore, why does 3*1378 divided by 39 give 4134/39 = 106. Wait, 4134 divided by 3 is 1378. 1378 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3*1378 is divisible by 39 if and only if 1378 is divisible by 13. Which it is, as 1378 = 13*106. Therefore, 39 divides 3*1378 because 13 divides 1378. But 3 and 1378 are coprime. Therefore, the key point is that even though 3 and 1378 are coprime, 39 divides 3*1378 because 13 divides 1378. Therefore, in this case, even though gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, n + 2 = 39 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) because 39 divides 3*1378 due to 13 dividing 1378. Therefore, this is a case where n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) even though gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, because n + 2 has a common factor with (n\u00b2 + 9), which is 13. Therefore, the previous reasoning that if gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, then n + 2 must divide 3 or (n\u00b2 + 9) is incorrect. Because even if gcd(3, n\u00b2 + 9) = 1, n + 2 could have a common factor with (n\u00b2 + 9) alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to consider that n + 2 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, if n + 2 divides 3, then n = 1. If not, then n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, in the case where n + 2 does not divide 3, we substitute n = -2 mod (n + 2) into the expression (n\u00b2 + 9), which gives 13. Therefore, n + 2 divides 13. Therefore, n + 2 = 1 or 13. n = 11. But in the case of n = 37, n + 2 = 39 does not divide 13, but does divide 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) because 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9). Wait, but n + 2 = 39 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3*1378 = 3*13*106. Therefore, 39 divides this because 39 = 3*13. Therefore, even though 13 divides (n\u00b2 + 9), 39 divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9) because it's allowed to divide 3*13*(something). Therefore, this is a special case where n + 2 is a multiple of both 3 and the factor in (n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, in this case, even though n + 2 doesn't divide 13 alone, it divides 3*13, which divides 3*(n\u00b2 + 9). Therefore, this is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the substitution method, considering all divisors of 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, 39, leading to n = 1, 11, 37. Their sum is 49.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}",
        "Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9), and then sum those n's up. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, the condition is that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). That means when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. So, mathematically, we can say that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). \n\nLet me write that down: 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). To solve this congruence, I can replace n with -2 in the expression, since in modular arithmetic, if n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), then n + 2 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since n + 2 divides the product, then n + 2 must divide at least one of the factors in the product. The factors here are 3, (n + 3), and (n\u00b2 + 9). Since 3 is a constant, n + 2 can't divide 3 unless 3 is a multiple of n + 2. But n is a positive integer, so n + 2 is at least 3 (when n = 1). Therefore, n + 2 can't be a divisor of 3 because 3 is prime and n + 2 \u2265 3. So n + 2 must divide either (n + 3) or (n\u00b2 + 9).\n\nSo, we have two cases:\n\n1. n + 2 divides (n + 3)\n2. n + 2 divides (n\u00b2 + 9)\n\nLet's tackle each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: n + 2 divides n + 3**\n\nIf n + 2 divides n + 3, then the quotient is 1, because n + 3 = (n + 2) + 1. So, (n + 2) divides (n + 3) + 1. Wait, actually, if n + 2 divides n + 3, then n + 3 = k(n + 2) for some integer k. Let's solve for k:\n\nn + 3 = k(n + 2)\n\nExpanding the right side: kn + 2k\n\nSo, kn + 2k = n + 3\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nFor n terms: k = 1\n\nFor constants: 2k = 3 => k = 3/2\n\nBut k must be an integer. Since k = 1 from the n term, but 2k = 3 implies k = 3/2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case. So, Case 1 yields no positive integers n.\n\n**Case 2: n + 2 divides n\u00b2 + 9**\n\nSo, we need to find all positive integers n such that n\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Let's write this congruence:\n\nn\u00b2 + 9 \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nTo solve this, we can substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, we can perform polynomial division of n\u00b2 + 9 by n + 2 to find the remainder, and set the remainder equal to zero.\n\nDividing n\u00b2 + 9 by n + 2:\n\nn + 2 ) n\u00b2 + 0n + 9\n\nFirst term: n * (n + 2) = n\u00b2 + 2n\n\nSubtract that from n\u00b2 + 0n + 9:\n\n(n\u00b2 + 0n + 9) - (n\u00b2 + 2n) = -2n + 9\n\nNow, bring down the next term (which is none, since there's only n\u00b2 + 9). Then we have:\n\nn + 2 ) -2n + 9\n\nNext term: (-2) * (n + 2) = -2n -4\n\nSubtract that from -2n + 9:\n\n(-2n + 9) - (-2n -4) = 13\n\nSo, the remainder is 13. Therefore, n\u00b2 + 9 = (n + 2)(n - 2) + 13\n\nHence, n + 2 divides 13. Since n + 2 is a positive integer (as n is positive), n + 2 must be a positive divisor of 13. The positive divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. Therefore:\n\nn + 2 = 1 => n = -1 (not a positive integer)\n\nn + 2 = 13 => n = 11\n\nTherefore, the only solution in Case 2 is n = 11.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. If n = 11, then n + 2 = 13, and the product is 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*132 = 3*14*132. Let's compute that: 3*14=42, 42*132= let's see, 132*40=5280, 132*2=264, so 5280+264=5544. Then 5544 divided by 13 (n + 2) is 5544 /13. Let's check 13*400=5200, 5544 -5200=344, 13*26=338, 344-338=6. So 400+26=426, remainder 6. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, 13*426=13*400 +13*26=5200+338=5538, then 5544 -5538=6. So remainder 6. That's not zero. Wait, that contradicts the conclusion. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If n=11, then n + 2=13, but 13 doesn't divide 3*14*132, which is 5544. Wait, but 13*426=5538, so 5544-5538=6. So remainder 6. That's not zero. So, my earlier conclusion must be wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let's check the polynomial division again.\n\nWe had n\u00b2 + 9 divided by n + 2. Let me do that step by step again.\n\nDivide n\u00b2 by n: n. Multiply (n + 2) by n: n\u00b2 + 2n. Subtract from n\u00b2 + 0n +9: (n\u00b2 +0n +9) - (n\u00b2 +2n) = -2n +9. Then divide -2n by n: -2. Multiply (n + 2) by -2: -2n -4. Subtract that from -2n +9: (-2n +9) - (-2n -4) = 13. So the remainder is 13. Therefore, n\u00b2 +9 = (n + 2)(n - 2) +13. Therefore, n + 2 divides 13. So n + 2 must divide 13. Since n is a positive integer, n + 2 is at least 3, so possible divisors are 13? But 1 is a divisor, but n + 2=1 gives n=-1, which isn't positive. So n +2=13 is the only possibility, leading to n=11. But when n=11, does 13 divide 3*14*132? Let's compute 3*14*132. 3*14=42, 42*132. Let me compute 42*130=5460, 42*2=84, so total 5460+84=5544. Then 5544 divided by 13. 13*400=5200, 13*26=338, 5200+338=5538. 5544-5538=6. So remainder 6. So that's not zero. So my conclusion that n=11 is a solution is wrong. Therefore, my mistake must be in the reasoning that n +2 divides n\u00b2 +9. Wait, but according to the division, n\u00b2 +9 \u226113 mod (n +2). Therefore, n +2 divides 13. So 13 \u22610 mod (n +2). Therefore, n +2 must divide 13. So possible n +2 are the positive divisors of 13, which are 1 and13. So n +2=13 gives n=11. But when we plug n=11 into the original condition, it's not working. Therefore, my mistake must be in the assumption that if n +2 divides 13, then n +2 divides the product. Wait, but the condition is that n +2 divides the product 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). But according to the division, n\u00b2 +9 \u226113 mod (n +2). Therefore, n\u00b2 +9 \u226113 mod (n +2). Then, the product 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u22613(n +3)*13 mod (n +2). Therefore, 3(n +3)*13 \u22610 mod (n +2). Therefore, 3(n +3)*13 \u22610 mod (n +2). So, 3*13(n +3) \u22610 mod (n +2). Therefore, 39(n +3) \u22610 mod (n +2). So, 39(n +3) \u22610 mod (n +2). Therefore, (n +2) divides 39(n +3). So, since (n +2) divides 39(n +3), and n +2 is either 1 or13. Wait, but n +2 is either 1 or13. So, n +2=1 gives n=-1, which is invalid. n +2=13 gives n=11. But in that case, 39(n +3)=39*14=546. Then 546 divided by13=42. So yes, 13 divides 546. Therefore, 39(n +3) is divisible by13, so 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) is divisible by13. Wait, but when we calculated 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) for n=11, we got 5544, which is 13*426 +6. But 39(n +3)=546, which is 13*42. So 39(n +3) is divisible by13. Then, (n\u00b2 +9) is 132 +9=141. 141 divided by13 is 10.846... Wait, 13*10=130, 141-130=11. So 141=13*10 +11. So 141 is not divisible by13. Therefore, the product (n +2) divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9), but in this case, n +2=13 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). But 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)=3*14*141=5544. 5544 divided by13 is 426.4615... which is not an integer. Wait, but 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)=3*14*141=3*14=42, 42*141=5922. Wait, wait, no. Wait, n +3=14, n\u00b2 +9=121 +9=130. Wait, n=11, so n\u00b2 +9=121 +9=130? Wait, 11 squared is 121, plus 9 is 130. So 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)=3*14*130. 3*14=42, 42*130=5460. 5460 divided by13 is 420. So 13*420=5460. So 5460 is divisible by13. Wait, so 3*14*130=5460, which is divisible by13. So then, 5460 divided by13 is 420. So n +2=13 divides 5460, so the remainder should be zero. But earlier when I calculated 3*14*132, I think I made a mistake. Wait, let's check again. If n=11, then n +3=14, and n\u00b2 +9=121 +9=130. So the product is 3*14*130. 3*14=42, 42*130: 42*100=4200, 42*30=1260, so 4200+1260=5460. 5460 divided by13: 13*400=5200, 5460-5200=260. 13*20=260. So 400+20=420. Therefore, 5460 is divisible by13. So 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)=5460 is divisible by13, so n=11 is a solution. Then why when I first computed 3*14*132, I got 5544? Because I must have miscalculated. Wait, n\u00b2 +9 when n=11 is 121 +9=130, not 132. So 132 was a mistake. So, 3*14*130=5460, which is divisible by13, hence remainder zero. So my initial calculation was wrong because I used n\u00b2 +9=132 instead of 130. So n=11 is indeed a solution. Therefore, my mistake was in the arithmetic earlier. So, n=11 is a valid solution.\n\nSo, in Case 2, we found n=11 as a solution. Now, are there any other solutions?\n\nWait, we considered n +2 divides 13, and the positive divisors are 1 and13. So n +2=1 gives n=-1, which is invalid, and n +2=13 gives n=11. But maybe there's another way to approach the congruence n\u00b2 +9 \u22610 mod (n +2). Let me try substituting n = -2 + k, where k is a positive integer. Let me see if this substitution helps.\n\nLet n = -2 + k, where k \u22651. Then:\n\nn +2 = k\n\nn +3 = k -2 +3 = k +1\n\nn\u00b2 +9 = (-2 +k)^2 +9 = 4 -4k +k\u00b2 +9 = k\u00b2 -4k +13\n\nSo, the product is 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Then, the condition is that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, k divides [3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)].\n\nBut since k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), and k divides k\u00b2 -4k +13, because k divides k\u00b2 -4k (since k divides k\u00b2 and k divides -4k) and k divides 13. Therefore, k divides 13. So, the positive divisors of13 are1 and13. Therefore, k=1 or k=13.\n\nIf k=1, then n = -2 +1 = -1, which is invalid.\n\nIf k=13, then n = -2 +13=11, which is valid. So, same result. Therefore, the only solution in Case2 is n=11.\n\nTherefore, the only positive integer n that satisfies the condition is 11. Therefore, the sum of all such n is 11.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=1: n +2=3, and the product is 3(4)(1 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120 divided by3 is40, so yes, 3 divides it. But the problem states n +2 divides the product. For n=1, n +2=3. Does3 divide3(4)(10)=120? Yes, 120 divided by3 is40. So n=1 is a solution? Wait, but according to our previous reasoning, n=1 would be in Case1, but we concluded that Case1 has no solutions. Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, if n=1, then n +2=3. Does3 divide3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)? The product is3*4*10=120, which is divisible by3. So indeed, n=1 is a solution. But according to our earlier analysis, in Case1, n +2 divides n +3. For n=1, n +2=3, and n +3=4. 3 divides4? No, 4 divided by3 is1 with remainder1. So, n=1 is not a solution in Case1. But it is a solution in the overall problem. So, where's the mistake here?\n\nWait, so in the problem statement, the condition is that n +2 divides the product 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). So, even if n +2 does not divide any of the individual factors, it could divide the product. So, in the initial analysis, I considered that n +2 must divide at least one of the factors, but that's not necessarily true. The general principle is that if a prime divides a product, it divides at least one of the factors. However, n +2 may not be prime, so it could divide the product even if it doesn't divide any of the individual factors. Therefore, my initial reasoning was flawed. I assumed that n +2 must divide one of the factors, but that's only true if n +2 is prime. If n +2 is composite, it might divide the product even if it doesn't divide any individual factor. So, that was a mistake.\n\nTherefore, my earlier approach was incorrect because I assumed that n +2 must divide one of the factors, but in reality, it could divide the product even if it doesn't divide any individual factor. Therefore, I need to approach this differently.\n\nSo, let's start over. The problem is to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, n + 2 | 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). To solve this, we can use the concept that if n + 2 divides the product, then it must divide the product of the individual terms. But since n + 2 might not be prime, it could divide the product even if it doesn't divide any individual term. Therefore, we need to consider all possible divisors.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the condition as:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2)\n\nTo solve this congruence, we can substitute n \u2261 -2 mod (n + 2), which is equivalent to n \u2261 -2 mod k, where k = n + 2. Therefore, n = -2 + k. Then, substitute into the expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((-2 + k) + 3)((-2 + k)\u00b2 + 9) = 3((k +1))((k\u00b2 -4k +4) +9) = 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)\n\nTherefore, the condition is that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Since k divides the product, and k divides k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), so k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Therefore, we can write:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u2261 0 mod k\n\nWhich means:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u2261 0 mod k\n\nBut since k divides k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), the term k divides the entire product, so when we factor out k, we have:\n\nk*(something) \u22610 mod k, which is always true. Therefore, it's redundant. Therefore, the condition reduces to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the entire expression, this is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut as above, k divides the entire expression, so the congruence is automatically satisfied. Therefore, this approach doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can factor the expression 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). Let's see if we can factor n\u00b2 +9. n\u00b2 +9 factors as (n + 3i)(n - 3i) in complex numbers, but since we are dealing with integers, it doesn't factor over integers. Therefore, n\u00b2 +9 is irreducible over integers. Therefore, the product 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) is a product of three terms: 3, (n +3), and (n\u00b2 +9). Since n +2 is a divisor of this product, and n +2 is at least 3 (since n is a positive integer), then we need to check if n +2 divides the product, which could happen if n +2 divides one of the factors, or if n +2 divides a combination of the factors. But since 3 is prime, n +2 could divide 3, or n +2 could divide (n +3), or n +2 could divide (n\u00b2 +9), or n +2 could divide combinations like 3*(n +3), or 3*(n\u00b2 +9), or (n +3)*(n\u00b2 +9). However, since n +2 is at least 3, and the other factors are 3, (n +3), and (n\u00b2 +9), which are all greater than or equal to 4 (since n \u22651). So, let's consider the possible cases where n +2 divides one of the factors, or a combination.\n\nBut since n +2 could divide a combination, this approach might not be straightforward. Alternatively, we can use the fact that if a prime number divides the product, it divides at least one of the factors. However, since n +2 is not necessarily prime, it might divide a combination. So, perhaps we need to consider both possibilities: n +2 divides one of the factors, or n +2 divides a combination of factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. Let me consider that n +2 divides 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). So, 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u22610 mod (n +2). Let me substitute n = -2 + k, as before, then express the entire expression in terms of k.\n\nLet n = -2 + k, so n +2 = k. Then:\n\n3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) =3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)\n\nSo, we need k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Let's factor out k from the first two terms:\n\nk divides 3k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)/k = 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Wait, but k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, we can write:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nWhich implies:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the term with k in it, this is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the entire expression, the congruence is automatically satisfied. Therefore, this approach doesn't give us new information. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that since n +2 divides the product, then n +2 divides the product modulo itself, which is trivial. So, we need to find n such that 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) \u22610 mod (n +2). To compute this congruence, we can replace n with -2 mod (n +2). Because n \u2261 -2 mod (n +2). Therefore, n \u2261 -2 mod k, where k = n +2. Therefore, n = -2 + k. Then, substituting into the expression:\n\n3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) =3((-2 +k) +3)((-2 +k)^2 +9)=3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +4 +9)=3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)\n\nSo, we have 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k. But since k divides the entire product, this congruence is automatically satisfied. Therefore, we need to find k such that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). But since k divides k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), which is the same as 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Therefore, k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, we can write:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the term k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), this simplifies to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut as before, this is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, the problem reduces to finding positive integers k \u22651 such that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). However, since k is a positive integer, and n = k -2, so n must be positive, which implies k \u22653 (since n = k -2 \u22651 implies k -2 \u22651 => k \u22653). Therefore, k \u22653.\n\nSo, we need to find k \u22653 such that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Let's denote this as:\n\nk | 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)\n\nSo, we need k divides the product 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Let's analyze this product.\n\nFirst, note that k divides the entire product, so k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Therefore, in particular, k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Let's factor out k from the product:\n\nk divides [k * 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)/k] = 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Wait, no, that's not correct. The product is 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), and k needs to divide this. Therefore, we can write:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nWhich implies:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nTherefore, 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), which is the original product, this is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), this congruence must hold. However, since k is a divisor of the entire expression, this condition is automatically satisfied. Therefore, this approach doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that since k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), and k is at least 3, we can look for k such that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Let's try small values of k starting from 3.\n\nLet's test k=3:\n\n3 divides 3(4)(9 -12 +13)=3*4*10=120. 120 divided by3 is40. So yes, 3 divides120. Therefore, n=3 -2=1. Wait, so k=3 gives n=1. But earlier, we saw that n=1 is a solution. So, n=1 is a solution. But according to our initial analysis, n=1 was in Case1, which we thought had no solutions, but actually, it's a solution here. So, k=3 is a possible value.\n\nk=3: n=1, solution.\n\nk=4:\n\n4 divides3*5*(16 -16 +13)=3*5*13=195. 195 divided by4 is48.75. Not an integer. So, 4 does not divide195. Therefore, k=4 is not a solution.\n\nk=5:\n\n5 divides3*6*(25 -20 +13)=3*6*18=324. 324 divided by5 is64.8. Not an integer. So, no.\n\nk=6:\n\n6 divides3*7*(36 -24 +13)=3*7*25=525. 525 divided by6 is87.5. Not integer. No.\n\nk=7:\n\n7 divides3*8*(49 -28 +13)=3*8*34=816. 816 divided by7\u2248116.571. Not integer. No.\n\nk=8:\n\n8 divides3*9*(64 -32 +13)=3*9*45=1215. 1215 divided by8=151.875. Not integer.\n\nk=9:\n\n9 divides3*10*(81 -36 +13)=3*10*58=1740. 1740 divided by9=193.333\u2026 Not integer.\n\nk=10:\n\n10 divides3*11*(100 -40 +13)=3*11*73=2451. 2451 divided by10=245.1. Not integer.\n\nk=11:\n\n11 divides3*12*(121 -44 +13)=3*12*90=3240. 3240 divided by11\u2248294.545\u2026 Not integer.\n\nk=12:\n\n12 divides3*13*(144 -48 +13)=3*13*109=4095. 4095 divided by12=341.25. Not integer.\n\nk=13:\n\n13 divides3*14*(169 -52 +13)=3*14*130=5460. 5460 divided by13=420. So yes, 13 divides5460. Therefore, k=13 is a solution. Therefore, n=13 -2=11, which we already found.\n\nk=14:\n\n14 divides3*15*(196 -56 +13)=3*15*153=6885. 6885 divided by14\u2248491.785\u2026 Not integer.\n\nk=15:\n\n15 divides3*16*(225 -60 +13)=3*16*178=8544. 8544 divided by15\u2248569.6. Not integer.\n\nContinuing this way, we can see that k=3 and k=13 are the only divisors up to some point. But since k must divide 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), and k is at least3, but 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) grows quickly, so we can check up to k=13 and see that only k=3 and k=13 work. Let's check k=17:\n\nk=17:\n\n17 divides3*18*(289 -68 +13)=3*18*234=12852. 12852 divided by17\u2248756. So, 17*750=12750, 12852-12750=102, 17*6=102, so 750+6=756. Therefore, 17*756=12852. Therefore, 17 divides12852. Therefore, k=17 is a solution. Therefore, n=17 -2=15. Wait, so n=15 is a solution?\n\nWait, let's verify. If n=15, then n +2=17. The product is 3(15 +3)(15\u00b2 +9)=3*18*234=3*18=54, 54*234=12576. Then, 12576 divided by17. Let's compute 17*700=11900, 12576 -11900=676, 17*40=680, 676-680=-4. So, 700 +40=740, but there is a remainder of4. Wait, but 12576 divided by17 is 740 with a remainder of4. So, 17*740=12580. 12580 -12576=4. So, remainder4. Therefore, 17 does not divide12576. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, 3*18*234=12576, and k=17, which gives n=15. But when we compute, it's not divisible by17. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, k=17, n=15. Let's compute 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9):\n\n3*(15 +3)*(15\u00b2 +9)=3*18*(225 +9)=3*18*234=3*18=54, 54*234=12576. Then, 12576 divided by17. Let's do division:\n\n17*700=11900\n\n12576 -11900=676\n\n17*40=680\n\n676 -680= -4\n\nSo, 700 +40=740, remainder -4. So, 12576=17*740 -4. Therefore, remainder4. So, 17 does not divide12576. Therefore, k=17 is not a solution. Therefore, my earlier conclusion was wrong. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, when k=17, the product is3*18*(289 -68 +13)=3*18*(234)=12576. But 289 -68 +13=234. Wait, but n=15: n\u00b2 +9=225 +9=234. Yes. So, that's correct. Then, 3*18*234=12576. So, 12576 divided by17 is740 with remainder4. Therefore, k=17 is not a solution. Therefore, my mistake was in thinking that 17 divides234*18*3, but it doesn't. Therefore, k=17 is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my initial approach of testing k values manually is error-prone. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the equation:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the entire expression, this simplifies to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the term k(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13), we can factor out k:\n\nk*(something) \u22610 mod k\n\nWhich is always true. Therefore, this congruence doesn't give us any new information. Therefore, perhaps we need to consider that k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Therefore, k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). So, we can write:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) = k * m, where m is an integer.\n\nTherefore, m = 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)/k =3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13)/k.\n\nBut since k divides the numerator, m must be an integer. Therefore, 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) must be divisible by k. So, we can write:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nExpanding this:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) =3(k\u00b2 -4k +13 +k\u00b3 -4k\u00b2 +13k)\n\n=3(k\u00b3 -3k\u00b2 +9k +13)\n\nTherefore, 3(k\u00b3 -3k\u00b2 +9k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut since k divides the entire expression, this simplifies to:\n\n3(k\u00b3 -3k\u00b2 +9k +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nBut k divides k\u00b3 -3k\u00b2 +9k, so:\n\nk\u00b3 -3k\u00b2 +9k =k(k\u00b2 -3k +9)\n\nTherefore, 3(k(k\u00b2 -3k +9) +13) \u22610 mod k\n\nSo,\n\n3k(k\u00b2 -3k +9) +39 \u22610 mod k\n\nBut 3k(k\u00b2 -3k +9) \u22610 mod k, since k divides 3k(k\u00b2 -3k +9). Therefore, the entire expression is congruent to39 mod k. Therefore:\n\n39 \u22610 mod k\n\nTherefore, k divides39.\n\nTherefore, the positive divisors of39 are1,3,13,39. But k must be at least3 (since n=k-2 \u22651 =>k\u22653). Therefore, possible k values are3,13,39.\n\nTherefore, k=3,13,39. Therefore, corresponding n values are:\n\nk=3: n=3-2=1\n\nk=13: n=13-2=11\n\nk=39: n=39-2=37\n\nTherefore, the possible solutions are n=1,11,37.\n\nTherefore, we need to verify these solutions.\n\nLet's check n=1:\n\nn=1, n +2=3. The product is3(1 +3)(1 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120 divided by3=40, so yes, divisible. So, n=1 is a solution.\n\nn=11:\n\nn=11, n +2=13. The product is3(11 +3)(11\u00b2 +9)=3*14*130=5460. 5460 divided by13=420, which is an integer. So, yes, n=11 is a solution.\n\nn=37:\n\nn=37, n +2=39. The product is3(37 +3)(37\u00b2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378=3*40=120, 120*1378=165,360. Now, divide165,360 by39. Let's compute165,360 \u00f739.\n\n39*4000=156,000\n\n165,360 -156,000=9,360\n\n39*200=7,800\n\n9,360 -7,800=1,560\n\n39*40=1,560\n\nTherefore, 4000 +200 +40=4240. Therefore,165,360=39*4240. Therefore,39 divides165,360. Therefore, n=37 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are n=1,11,37. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers n is1 +11 +37=49.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check n=37. Let's compute the product again:\n\n3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9) when n=37:\n\n3*(37 +3)*(37\u00b2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378=3*40=120, 120*1378=165,360. Then, 165,360 \u00f739=4240. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, n=37 is indeed a solution.\n\nTherefore, all solutions are n=1,11,37, and their sum is49.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I considered k=3,13,39, the corresponding n=1,11,37. Therefore, the answer should be49.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=37 in the original condition. n +2=39 divides3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). 3(n +3)=3*40=120, n\u00b2 +9=1369 +9=1378. So, 120*1378=165,360. 165,360 divided by39=4240. Yes, that works.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are1,11,37, and their sum is49.\n\nBut wait, initially, when I considered k=3,13,39, but in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n=1,11,37 are all positive. Therefore, the answer is49.\n\nBut earlier, when I first approached the problem, I missed n=1 andn=37 because I incorrectly assumed that n +2 must divide one of the factors. But by considering that k divides39, we found the correct solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}",
        "Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n+2 divides the product 3(n+3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, once I find those n, I have to sum them up. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's restate the condition: For a positive integer n, n + 2 must be a divisor of the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). That means when we divide 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) by n + 2, the result should be an integer. So, mathematically, this implies that 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). \n\nSince we're dealing with modular arithmetic, maybe I can use the property that if a \u2261 b mod m, then any expression involving a can be rewritten in terms of b. Here, the modulus is n + 2, so any term involving n can be replaced with (n + 2 - 2). Let me try to express n in terms of n + 2. Let me set k = n + 2. Then n = k - 2. This substitution might simplify things because we can express the entire left-hand side in terms of k, and then the condition becomes that k divides the expression. \n\nSo substituting n = k - 2 into the original expression:\n\n3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) = 3((k - 2) + 3)((k - 2)\u00b2 + 9) = 3(k + 1)( (k\u00b2 - 4k + 4) + 9 ) = 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all positive integers k such that k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). \n\nBut wait, k = n + 2, and n is a positive integer. So k must be greater than 2, since n is at least 1. Therefore, k \u2265 3. So we need to find all integers k \u2265 3 such that k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). \n\nAlternatively, since k divides the product, then k must divide at least one of the factors. So, k divides 3, or k divides (k + 1), or k divides (k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). Let's check each possibility.\n\nFirst, k divides 3. Since k \u2265 3, the possible values of k are 3. But let's check if k = 3 is a solution. If k = 3, then n = 1. Let's plug n = 1 into the original expression: 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. Then n + 2 = 3, and 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So k = 3 is a solution. Therefore, n = 1 is a valid solution.\n\nNext, check if k divides (k + 1). Since k divides k + 1, then k divides 1. So k must be a divisor of 1. The divisors of 1 are \u00b11. But since k \u2265 3, this case is impossible. So there are no solutions in this case.\n\nThird, check if k divides (k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). So we need k divides k\u00b2 - 4k + 13. Let's write this as k\u00b2 - 4k + 13 \u2261 0 mod k. Which simplifies to (k\u00b2 - 4k) \u2261 -13 mod k. But k\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod k, so 0 - 4k \u2261 -13 mod k. Then -4k \u2261 -13 mod k. Let's divide both sides by -1: 4k \u2261 13 mod k. But 4k mod k is 0, so 0 \u2261 13 mod k. Which implies that k divides 13. So the possible values of k are the divisors of 13. Since 13 is prime, its divisors are 1, 13, and -1, -13. But k \u2265 3, so only k = 13 is possible. So k = 13. Then n = k - 2 = 11. Let's check n = 11.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let's compute that: 3*14 = 42, 42*130. Let's compute 42*100 = 4200, 42*30 = 1260, so total 4200 + 1260 = 5460. Then n + 2 = 13. 5460 divided by 13 is 5460 / 13. Let's compute that: 13*400 = 5200, 5460 - 5200 = 260. 260 / 13 = 20. So total is 400 + 20 = 420. So 5460 / 13 = 420, which is an integer. So n = 11 is a valid solution.\n\nSo the possible values of k are 3 and 13, leading to n = 1 and n = 11. But wait, are there any other possible values? Let me double-check.\n\nWe considered k dividing 3, which gave k = 3. Then k dividing k + 1, which is impossible. Then k dividing k\u00b2 - 4k + 13, leading to k = 13. So those are the two possibilities. Therefore, the only solutions are n = 1 and n = 11. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other factors. For example, maybe k divides 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13), but k doesn't divide 3, k + 1, or k\u00b2 - 4k + 13 individually. But in that case, k would have to divide the product, so it would divide at least one of the factors. So by the property of divisors, if a prime divides a product, it divides at least one factor. However, if k is composite, it may divide the product even if it doesn't divide any individual factor. But in our case, since k is greater or equal to 3, and 3 and 13 are primes, but if k is composite, say k = 15, then 15 divides the product. Let's check if k = 15 is a possible solution.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I missed some cases. Let me check k = 15. Let's compute the expression 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13) when k = 15. 3*(16)*(225 - 60 + 13) = 3*16*178. 3*16 = 48, 48*178. Let's compute 48*100 = 4800, 48*70 = 3360, 48*8 = 384. So total is 4800 + 3360 = 8160 + 384 = 8544. Then divided by 15: 8544 / 15. Let's compute: 15*560 = 8400, 8544 - 8400 = 144. 144 / 15 = 9.6. So 560 + 9.6 = 569.6, which is not an integer. So k = 15 is not a solution. Therefore, even though 15 divides the product, when we divide the entire expression by 15, it's not an integer. So perhaps k must divide at least one of the factors. So maybe our initial approach is correct, that k must divide 3, k + 1, or k\u00b2 - 4k + 13.\n\nBut let me verify with another composite number. Let's take k = 6. Then the expression is 3*(7)*(36 - 24 + 13) = 3*7*25 = 525. Then 525 divided by 6 is 87.5, which is not an integer. So k = 6 is not a solution. So maybe the initial approach is correct. Therefore, only k = 3 and k = 13 work.\n\nWait, but let's check another composite number that is a divisor of 13, but since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1, 13, -1, -13. So k must be 13. So maybe there are no other solutions. Let me check k = 13 again. We already did that, and it worked.\n\nWait, but let me check another composite number that might divide 3(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - 4k + 13). For example, let's take k = 21. Then compute the expression: 3*22*(441 - 84 + 13) = 3*22*(370). 3*22 = 66, 66*370. 66*300 = 19,800, 66*70 = 4,620. Total is 19,800 + 4,620 = 24,420. Divided by 21: 24,420 / 21 = 1,163. Which is an integer. Wait, so k = 21 divides the product. But according to our earlier reasoning, k must divide 3, k + 1, or k\u00b2 - 4k + 13. Let's check if 21 divides any of those.\n\n21 divides 3: 3 divides 21. So 21 divides 3* something. Wait, 21 divides 3*(k + 1)*(k\u00b2 - 4k +13). So if 21 divides 3, then 21 divides 3*(something). But 21 doesn't divide 3, since 21 is a multiple of 3, but 21 is 3*7. So 3 divides 21, but 21 doesn't divide 3. So 21 can't divide 3. So then, is there another possibility? Wait, but according to the problem statement, n + 2 divides the product. So in this case, k = 21 divides the product. But according to our previous logic, since 21 is composite, and 21 divides the product, it must divide at least one of the factors. But 21 divides 3*(k + 1)*(k\u00b2 - 4k +13). Let's check if 21 divides 3: no, because 3 divides 21, but 21 doesn't divide 3. Then check if 21 divides k + 1. If k = 21, then k + 1 = 22. 21 divides 22? No. Then check if 21 divides k\u00b2 - 4k +13. k =21: 21\u00b2 -4*21 +13 = 441 -84 +13 = 370. 370 divided by 21 is 17.619... Not an integer. So 21 doesn't divide 3, k +1, or k\u00b2 -4k +13. But 21 divides the product. So this contradicts our earlier reasoning. Therefore, our initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, so there's a mistake here. So the assumption that if a prime p divides the product, then p divides at least one factor is correct, but when dealing with composite numbers, even if the composite number divides the product, it might not divide any individual factor. Therefore, our initial reasoning that k must divide 3, k +1, or k\u00b2 -4k +13 is incorrect for composite k. Therefore, we need a different approach.\n\nSo perhaps we need to check for all possible k \u22653, whether k divides 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). This might be tedious, but maybe there's a pattern. Let's see. Alternatively, we can write the condition as 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k. Let's expand this expression modulo k.\n\nFirst, note that k \u22610 mod k, so k\u00b2 \u22610 mod k, and similarly, k\u00b3 \u22610 mod k, etc. Let's compute each term modulo k.\n\nFirst, 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Let's expand this expression:\n\nFirst, expand (k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13):\n\n= k*(k\u00b2 -4k +13) +1*(k\u00b2 -4k +13)\n\n= k\u00b3 -4k\u00b2 +13k +k\u00b2 -4k +13\n\n= k\u00b3 -3k\u00b2 +9k +13\n\nThen multiply by 3:\n\n3k\u00b3 -9k\u00b2 +27k +39\n\nSo the entire expression is 3k\u00b3 -9k\u00b2 +27k +39 \u22610 mod k.\n\nNow, divide each term by k:\n\n3k\u00b2 -9k +27 + 39/k \u22610 mod k.\n\nBut 39/k is not an integer unless k divides 39. So perhaps this approach isn't helpful. Alternatively, since we're working modulo k, we can substitute k \u22610 mod k. Let's do that.\n\nLet me write the original expression:\n\n3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k.\n\nSince modulo k, k \u22610, so substitute k \u22610:\n\n3(0 +1)(0 -0 +13) \u22610 mod k.\n\nWhich simplifies to 3*1*(13) \u22610 mod k.\n\nSo 39 \u22610 mod k. Therefore, k divides 39. Therefore, the possible values of k are the positive divisors of 39 that are greater or equal to 3. \n\n39 factors into 3*13. So the positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since k \u22653, possible k values are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = k -2 =1, 11, 37.\n\nWait, so this is a different approach. Let me verify this.\n\nStarting from the original expression: 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9). We set k = n +2, so n =k -2. Then the expression becomes 3(k +1)( (k -2)^2 +9 ). Compute (k -2)^2 +9 =k\u00b2 -4k +4 +9 =k\u00b2 -4k +13. So the expression is 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13). Then, the condition is that k divides this expression. So 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) \u22610 mod k. Simplify modulo k:\n\nSince k \u22610 mod k, substitute k=0 in the expression:\n\n3(0 +1)(0 -0 +13) =3*1*13=39\u22610 mod k. Therefore, k divides 39. Therefore, k must be a divisor of 39. Therefore, k can be 1, 3, 13, 39. Since k =n +2 \u22653, then k=3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of n are 1,11,37. So the answer should be 1 +11 +37=49. But wait, let me check this with the earlier example where k=21. According to this, k must divide 39, so k=21 is not a divisor of 39. Therefore, the earlier example where k=21 divides the product but isn't a divisor of 39 is invalid. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when k=21, the expression is 3(k +1)(k\u00b2 -4k +13) =3*22*(441 -84 +13)=3*22*370=3*22*370. Let's compute this: 3*22=66, 66*370. Let's compute 66*300=19,800 and 66*70=4,620. So total is 19,800 +4,620=24,420. Then divide by 21: 24,420 /21=24,420 \u00f721. 21*1,000=21,000. 24,420 -21,000=3,420. 21*160=3,360. 3,420 -3,360=60. 60 \u00f721\u22482.857. So total is 1,000 +160 +2.857\u22481,162.857, which is not an integer. Wait, but earlier I thought I got an integer. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 24,420 divided by 21. Let me do it step by step:\n\n21*1,000=21,000\n\n24,420 -21,000=3,420\n\n21*160=3,360\n\n3,420 -3,360=60\n\n60 divided by 21 is 2 with remainder 18. So total is 1,000 +160 +2 +18/21. So it's not an integer. Therefore, k=21 does not divide the product, so my previous conclusion was wrong. Therefore, the correct approach is that k must divide 39, hence k=3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37. Then sum is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut let me verify each n:\n\nn=1: 3*(1+3)*(1+9)=3*4*10=120. n+2=3. 120/3=40. Correct.\n\nn=11: 3*(11+3)*(121 +9)=3*14*130=5460. n+2=13. 5460/13=420. Correct.\n\nn=37: 3*(37+3)*(37\u00b2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378. Let's compute 3*40=120. 120*1378. Let's compute 120*1000=120,000; 120*300=36,000; 120*70=8,400; 120*8=960. So total is 120,000 +36,000=156,000 +8,400=164,400 +960=165,360. Then n+2=39. 165,360 divided by 39. Let's compute 39*4,000=156,000. 165,360 -156,000=9,360. 39*200=7,800. 9,360 -7,800=1,560. 39*40=1,560. So total is 4,000 +200 +40=4,240. So 165,360 /39=4,240. Which is an integer. Correct.\n\nTherefore, n=37 is a valid solution. Therefore, the three solutions are 1,11,37, summing to 49.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other divisors. The divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39. Since k must be \u22653, so 3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37. So the answer is 1+11+37=49.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"sum of all positive integers n\". So 49 is the answer. But let me check once again if there are any other divisors. For example, negative divisors. But since n is a positive integer, k =n +2 must be at least 3, so negative divisors are irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}",
        "Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, sum all those n. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the condition is that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). That means 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) is divisible by n + 2. So, mathematically, that translates to 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). \n\nSince we're dealing with modular arithmetic here, maybe I can use some substitution. Let me set x = n + 2. Then, n = x - 2. Let's substitute that into the expression 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) and see if we can simplify it modulo x.\n\nSo, substituting n = x - 2:\n\nFirst, compute n + 3: (x - 2) + 3 = x + 1.\n\nThen, compute n\u00b2 + 9: (x - 2)\u00b2 + 9 = x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 + 9 = x\u00b2 - 4x + 13.\n\nSo, the product becomes 3(x + 1)(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Therefore, modulo x, we have:\n\n3(x + 1)(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13) \u2261 0 mod x.\n\nSince x \u2261 0 mod x, the term (x + 1) \u2261 1 mod x. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 3(1)(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13) \u2261 0 mod x. Therefore, 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13) \u2261 0 mod x. So, 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13) must be divisible by x. Since 3 and x are coprime (because x = n + 2 and n is a positive integer, so x \u2265 3 when n = 1, but 3 and x can share a common factor if x is a multiple of 3. Wait, but x is n + 2, so unless n + 2 is a multiple of 3, 3 and x are coprime. If x is a multiple of 3, then 3 divides x, so 3 divides the entire expression. But even if they're not coprime, we can still write the divisibility condition as x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). So, x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Therefore, x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Since x divides the left side, and 3 is a constant, but maybe we can factor out x from the expression? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13), then x divides (x\u00b2 - 4x + 13) if 3 and x are coprime. Otherwise, if x is divisible by 3, then x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13) even if x doesn't divide (x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Hmm, maybe this complicates things. Let's see.\n\nSo, either case, x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Therefore, x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Let's write this as x | 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Which implies that x divides 3x\u00b2 -12x + 39. So, x | 3x\u00b2 -12x + 39. So, 3x\u00b2 -12x + 39 \u2261 0 mod x. Therefore, 3x\u00b2 -12x + 39 \u2261 0 mod x. But since x \u2261 0 mod x, then 3(0) -12(0) + 39 \u2261 0 mod x. Therefore, 39 \u2261 0 mod x. So, x divides 39. Therefore, x is a positive divisor of 39. Since x = n + 2 and n is a positive integer, x must be at least 3 (since n \u2265 1). Therefore, x is a positive divisor of 39 greater than or equal to 3. The divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. So, possible x values are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, or 39. Therefore, n can be 1, 11, or 37. Then, the sum of these n values is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Wait, but let me check if this is correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify the logic here. We started with the condition that n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). Then, we substituted x = n + 2, leading to x divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 13). Then, we concluded that x divides 3x\u00b2 -12x + 39, which simplifies to 39 \u2261 0 mod x. Therefore, x divides 39. So, x is a divisor of 39. However, since n is a positive integer, x = n + 2 must be at least 3. Therefore, x can be 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n = 1, 11, 37. Then, the sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49. Hmm, but let me check if each of these n actually satisfies the original condition.\n\nFirst, let's check n = 1. Then, n + 2 = 3. The product is 3(1 + 3)(1\u00b2 + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So, 3 divides 120. So, that's good.\n\nNext, n = 11. n + 2 = 13. The product is 3(11 + 3)(11\u00b2 + 9) = 3*14*132. Let's compute 14*132 first. 14*100 = 1400, 14*32 = 448, so total 1400 + 448 = 1848. Then, 3*1848 = 5544. Now, 5544 divided by 13. Let's check: 13*426 = 5538, so 5544 - 5538 = 6. So, 5544 /13 = 426 + 6/13. Wait, that's not an integer. Wait, that contradicts our earlier conclusion. Wait, but according to our substitution, x = 13 divides 3(x\u00b2 - 4x +13). Let me check that. x = 13. Then, 3(13\u00b2 -4*13 +13) = 3(169 -52 +13) = 3(130) = 390. 390 divided by 13 is 30, which is an integer. Wait, but the original expression is 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). For n =11, that is 3*14*132 = 5544. 5544 divided by 13. Wait, 13*426 = 5538, 5544 -5538 =6, so 5544 is not divisible by 13. But according to the substitution, x divides 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13). For x=13, 3(13\u00b2 -4*13 +13)=3(169 -52 +13)=3(130)=390, which is divisible by 13. But the original product is 5544, which is not divisible by 13. So, there's a contradiction here. So, my previous reasoning must be flawed.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me retrace the steps.\n\nStarting with the original condition: n + 2 divides 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9). So, 3(n + 3)(n\u00b2 + 9) \u2261 0 mod (n + 2). Then, substituting x = n + 2, so n = x - 2. Then, n + 3 = x + 1, n\u00b2 +9 = x\u00b2 -4x +13. Therefore, the product becomes 3(x +1)(x\u00b2 -4x +13). Then, modulo x, this is 3*(1)*(x\u00b2 -4x +13) \u2261 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13) \u2261 0 mod x. Therefore, 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13) \u22610 mod x, which implies that x divides 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13). So, x divides 3x\u00b2 -12x +39. Therefore, 3x\u00b2 -12x +39 \u22610 mod x. But 3x\u00b2 -12x +39 \u22610 +0 +39 \u226139 mod x. Therefore, x divides 39. So, x must be a divisor of 39. So, possible x values are 1, 3, 13, 39. But since n is a positive integer, x = n + 2 must be at least 3. Therefore, x=3,13,39. Hence, n=1,11,37.\n\nBut when we checked n=11, it didn't work. So, clearly, there's a mistake here. So, my reasoning after substitution must be wrong. Wait, why?\n\nWait, if x divides 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13), then x divides 3x\u00b2 -12x +39. But 3x\u00b2 -12x +39 = 3x\u00b2 -12x +39. If we divide this by x, we get 3x -12 + 39/x. So, unless x divides 39, this division isn't exact. So, 3x\u00b2 -12x +39 \u22610 mod x. Which is equivalent to 39 \u22610 mod x. So, x divides 39. Therefore, x must be a divisor of 39. So, that part seems right. But when x=13, 3x\u00b2 -12x +39 =3*169 -12*13 +39=507 -156 +39=507-156=351; 351+39=390. 390 divided by 13 is 30, which is an integer. So, 13 divides 390. But in the original problem, when n=11, 3(n +3)(n\u00b2 +9)=5544, which is not divisible by 13. So, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my mistake must be in the substitution step.\n\nWait, let's check the substitution again. When we substitute x =n +2, then n =x -2. So, n +3 =x -2 +3 =x +1. That's correct. Then, n\u00b2 +9 = (x -2)\u00b2 +9 =x\u00b2 -4x +4 +9 =x\u00b2 -4x +13. Correct. Then, the product becomes 3(x +1)(x\u00b2 -4x +13). So, modulo x, this is 3*(1)*(x\u00b2 -4x +13) mod x. Therefore, 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13) mod x. But x\u00b2 -4x +13 mod x is equal to x\u00b2 mod x is 0, -4x mod x is 0, so 13 mod x. Therefore, 3*13 mod x. Therefore, 39 mod x \u22610. Therefore, x divides 39. So, that is correct. Therefore, x must divide 39, so x=1,3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37. But when n=11, the original expression is 5544, which is not divisible by 13. But according to the substitution, it should be. So, why is this discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the product for n=11. Let's check again.\n\nn=11: n +2=13. The product is 3*(11 +3)*(11\u00b2 +9)=3*14*132. Let's compute 14*132. 14*100=1400, 14*30=420, 14*2=28. 1400+420=1820, 1820+28=1848. Then, 3*1848=5544. Now, 5544 divided by 13. Let's divide 5544 by 13. 13*400=5200. 5544-5200=344. 13*26=338. 344-338=6. So, 400+26=426, remainder 6. So, 5544=13*426 +6. So, 5544 is not divisible by 13. But according to the substitution, 3(x\u00b2 -4x +13)=3(169 -52 +13)=3(130)=390, which is divisible by 13. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait, here's the mistake. When we substitute x =n +2, we get the product 3(x +1)(x\u00b2 -4x +13). However, when n=11, x=13, so the product becomes 3(14)(13\u00b2 -4*13 +13)=3*14*(169 -52 +13)=3*14*130=3*14*130=5460. Wait, but earlier calculation gave 5544. Wait, that's different! Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, n\u00b2 +9 when n=11 is 121 +9=130. So, 13\u00b2 -4*13 +13=169 -52 +13=130. So, 3*(x +1)*(x\u00b2 -4x +13)=3*14*130=3*14*130=5460. But when we compute 3*(11 +3)*(11\u00b2 +9)=3*14*130=5460. But earlier, when I calculated, I thought 11\u00b2 +9=132. Wait, 11 squared is 121, 121 +9=130. So, 11\u00b2 +9=130. So, my mistake was miscalculating 11\u00b2 as 121, which is correct, but then adding 9 gives 130, not 132. So, 11\u00b2 +9=130. Therefore, the product is 3*14*130=5460. Then, 5460 divided by 13: let's check. 13*400=5200. 5460-5200=260. 13*20=260. So, 400+20=420. Therefore, 5460=13*420. So, 5460 is divisible by 13. So, 13 divides 5460. So, n=11 is valid. My earlier mistake was miscalculating 11\u00b2 +9 as 132 instead of 130. So, that was my error. Therefore, n=11 is indeed a solution.\n\nSo, the initial conclusion was correct. x must divide 39, so x=3,13,39. Therefore, n=1,11,37. Then, the sum is 1+11+37=49. So, the answer is 49. However, let me check n=37 as well.\n\nn=37: n +2=39. The product is 3*(37 +3)*(37\u00b2 +9)=3*40*(1369 +9)=3*40*1378. Let's compute 40*1378. 40*1000=40,000; 40*378=15,120. So, 40,000 +15,120=55,120. Then, 3*55,120=165,360. Now, 165,360 divided by 39. Let's compute 39*4000=156,000. 165,360 -156,000=9,360. 39*240=9,360. Therefore, 4000 +240=4240. So, 165,360=39*4240. Therefore, 39 divides 165,360. So, n=37 is valid.\n\nTherefore, all three values of n=1,11,37 satisfy the condition, and their sum is 49. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's check n=1. n +2=3. Product=3*(1+3)*(1 +9)=3*4*10=120. 120 divided by 3=40, which is an integer. So, n=1 works. n=11: product=3*14*130=5460, which is divisible by 13. n=37: product=165,360, which is divisible by 39. So, all three n values work. Therefore, the sum is 49.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{49}"
