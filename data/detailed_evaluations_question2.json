The condition is $n+2 | P(n)$.\n\nWe can use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem. For a polynomial $P(x)$, the remainder upon division by $x-a$ is $P(a)$.\nIn our case, the polynomial is $P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)$ in the variable $n$, and the divisor is $n+2$, which can be written as $n-(-2)$. So, $a=-2$.\n\nThe remainder when $P(n)$ is divided by $n+2$ is $P(-2)$.\nLet's calculate this remainder:\n$P(-2) = 3((-2)+3)((-2)^2+9)$\n$P(-2) = 3(1)(4+9)$\n$P(-2) = 3(13)$\n$P(-2) = 39$.\n\nSo, we can write $P(n)$ in the form $P(n) = Q(n)(n+2) + 39$, where $Q(n)$ is the quotient polynomial.\nFor $n+2$ to divide $P(n)$, it must be that $n+2$ divides $Q(n)(n+2) + 39$.\nSince $n+2$ clearly divides $Q(n)(n+2)$, the condition simplifies to $n+2$ must divide the remainder, 39.\nSo, $n+2$ must be a divisor of 39.\n\nThe divisors of 39 are $1, 3, 13, 39$.\nThe problem states that $n$ must be a positive integer, which means $n \\ge 1$.\nThis imposes a condition on $n+2$:\n$n \\ge 1 \\implies n+2 \\ge 1+2 \\implies n+2 \\ge 3$.\n\nSo, $n+2$ must be a divisor of 39 that is greater than or equal to 3.\nThe possible values for $n+2$ are therefore $3, 13, 39$.\n\nWe can find the corresponding values of $n$ for each of these cases:\n1.

        "original_response": "Let the given condition be $n+2 \\mid 3(n+3)(n^2+9)$.\nWe are looking for the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet $P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)$. The condition is that $n+2$ divides $P(n)$.\nWe can use modular arithmetic to simplify this condition. The statement $a \\mid b$ is equivalent to $b \\equiv 0 \\pmod a$.\nSo, we have $3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n+2}$.\n\nTo evaluate the expression on the left modulo $n+2$, we can use the property that for any integer $n$, $n \\equiv -2 \\pmod{n+2}$.\nWe can substitute $n=-2$ into the expression:\n$3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 3((-2)+3)((-2)^2+9) \\pmod{n+2}$.\n$3(1)(4+9) \\pmod{n+2}$.\n$3(13) \\pmod{n+2}$.\n$39 \\pmod{n+2}$.\n\nSo, the original condition $3(n+3)(n^2+9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n+2}$ is equivalent to the much simpler condition $39 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n+2}$.\nThis means that $n+2$ must be a divisor of 39.\n\nLet's list the divisors of 39. The prime factorization of 39 is $3 \\times 13$. The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39. Since divisors can be negative, the full list of divisors of 39 is $\\{-39, -13, -3, -1, 1, 3, 13, 39\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for positive integers $n$. This means $n$ must be in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nIf $n \\ge 1$, then $n+2 \\ge 1+2 = 3$.\nSo, $n+2$ must be a divisor of 39 that is greater than or equal to 3.\nFrom the list of positive divisors $\\{1, 3, 13, 39\\}$, the values that satisfy this condition are $\\{3, 13, 39\\}$.\n\nWe can now find the possible values of $n$ corresponding to each of these cases:\n1. If $n+2 = 3$, then $n = 3 - 2 = 1$. Since $n=1$ is a positive integer, this is a valid solution.\n2. If $n+2 = 13$, then $n = 13 - 2 = 11$. Since $n=11$ is a positive integer, this is a valid solution.\n3. If $n+2 = 39$, then $n = 39 - 2 = 37$. Since $n=37$ is a positive integer, this is a valid solution.\n\nThe set of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition is $\\{1, 11, 37\\}$.\nThe question asks for the sum of all such positive integers $n$.\nSum = $1 + 11 + 37$.\nSum = $12 + 37$.\nSum = $49$.\n\nTo be fully rigorous, we can show the equivalence without modular arithmetic.\nLet $P(n) = 3(n+3)(n^2+9)$. We can perform a polynomial division of $P(x)$ by $x+2$.\n$P(x) = Q(x)(x+2) + R$, where $R$ is the remainder. By the Remainder Theorem, $R=P(-2)=39$.\nSo, $3(n+3)(n^2+9) = Q(n)(n+2) + 39$ for some integer $Q(n)$ when $n$ is an integer.\nFor $n+2$ to divide $3(n+3)(n^2+9)$, it must divide $Q(n)(n+2) + 39$.\nSince $n+2$ always divides $Q(n)(n+2)$, the condition simplifies to $n+2$ must divide the remainder, which is 39. This confirms the previous reasoning.\n\nThe possible values for $n$ are $1, 11, 37$.\nThe sum of these values is $1+11+37=49$.\n\n",

The positive divisors of 39 are $1, 3, 13, 39$.\nAs established earlier, $k = n+2$ and $n$ is a positive integer, so $n \\ge 1$. This means $k \\ge 1+2=3$.\nTherefore, we must select the divisors of 39 that are greater than or equal to 3.\nThe possible values for $k$ are $3, 13, 39$.\n\nFor each possible value of $k$, we find the corresponding value of $n$:\n1. If $k=3$:\n   $n+2 = 3 \\implies n=1$.\n   Let's check this solution: $n+2=3$ divides $3(1+3)(1^2+9) = 3(4)(10) = 120$. Since $120/3=40$, $n=1$ is a valid solution.\n\n2. If $k=13$:\n   $n+2 = 13 \\implies n=11$.\n   Let's check this solution: $n+2=13$ divides $3(11+3)(11^2+9) = 3(14)(121+9) = 3(14)(130)$. Since $130 = 13 \\times 10$, $13$ divides $3(14)(13 \\times 10)$. This is clearly true, so $n=11$ is a valid solution.\n\n3. If $k=39$:\n   $n+2 = 39 \\implies n=37$.\n   Let's check this solution: $n+2=39$ divides $3(37+3)(37^2+9) = 3(40)(1369+9) = 3(40)(1378)$. We need to check if $39$ divides $3(40)(1378)$. Since $39 = 3 \\times 13$, this is equivalent to checking if $13$ divides $40 \\times 1378$.\n   $1378 \\div 13 = 106$ (since $13 \\times 100 = 1300$ and $13 \\times 6 = 78$, so $1300+78=1378$).\n   Since $1378$ is divisible by $13$, $3(40)(1378)$ is divisible by $3 \\times 13 = 39$. So $n=37$ is a valid solution.\n\nThe positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are $1, 11, 37$.\nThe sum of all such positive integers $n$ is $1+11+37 = 49$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{49}$.",
