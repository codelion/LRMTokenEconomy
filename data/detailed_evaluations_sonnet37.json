So n+2 will divide our expression if and only if n+2 divides the value of the expression at n = -2.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression at n = -2:\n3(-2+3)((-2)\u00b2+9) = 3(1)(4+9) = 3(1)(13) = 39\n\nThis means that our original expression can be written as:\n3(n+3)(n\u00b2+9) = (n+2)\u00b7Q(n) + 39\n\nwhere Q(n) is some polynomial. For n+2 to divide the expression, it must divide 39.\n\n## Step 2: Find divisors of 39\nThe prime factorization of 39 is 3\u00d713, so its factors are:\n1, 3, 13, and 39\n\n## Step 3: Determine possible values of n\nIf n+2 divides 39, then n+2 must equal one of these factors:\n- If n+2 = 1, then n = -1 (negative, so discard)\n- If n+2 = 3, then n = 1\n- If n+2 = 13, then n = 11\n- If n+2 = 39, then n = 37\n\n## Step 4: Verify these values\nLet's check each positive value directly:\n\nFor n = 1:\n- n+2 = 3\n- 3(1+3)(1\u00b2+9) = 3(4)(10) = 120\n- 120 \u00f7 3 = 40, which is an integer \u2713\n\nFor n = 11:\n- n+2 = 13\n- 3(11+3)(11\u00b2+9) = 3(14)(130) = 5,460\n- 5,460 \u00f7 13 = 420, which is an integer \u2713\n\nFor n = 37:\n- n+2 = 39\n- 3(37+3)(37\u00b2+9) = 3(40)(1,378) = 165,360\n- 165,360 \u00f7 39 = 4,240, which is an integer \u2713\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum\nThe positive integers n that satisfy our condition are 1, 11, and 37.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.",

If multiple words start with the same letter, then the one with the later second letter comes last.\n\nG can appear in the last word in two ways:\n1. G is the first letter of the last word\n2. G is the second letter of the last word\n\n### Case 1: G is the first letter of the last word\nFor G to be the first letter, it must be paired with one of H, I, J, K, L. Also, no word can start with a letter coming after G alphabetically (otherwise such a word would come after the G-word). This means H, I, J, K cannot be first letters of any words.\n\nFor H, I, J, K not to be first letters, they must all be second letters. Since L can only be a second letter (there's no letter after it), we need all 5 letters H, I, J, K, L to be second letters in 5 words.\n\nHowever, if G is paired with one of these 5 letters, we'd have only 4 letters left to be second letters in 5 words, which is impossible.

For this word to be last, its first letter must be the latest alphabetically among all first letters.\n\nThe latest possible first letter is F, so the word would be FG. For FG to be the last word, no word can start with a letter after F. This means G, H, I, J, K cannot be first letters.\n\nThis is possible if G, H, I, J, K, L are all second letters. G is already paired with F, so the remaining 5 letters H, I, J, K, L must be paired with A, B, C, D, E.\n\n## Calculating the Probability\n\n- For FG to be the last word, F must be paired with G, and the letters H, I, J, K, L must be paired with A, B, C, D, E.\n- Number of ways to pair A, B, C, D, E with H, I, J, K, L: 5! = 120\n- Total number of ways to pair 12 letters into 6 pairs: $\\frac{12!}{2^6 \\cdot 6!}$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$\\frac{5! \\cdot 2^6 \\cdot 6!}{12!} = \\frac{120 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 720}{479,001,600} = \\frac{7,680}{665,280} = \\frac{8}{693}$\n\nSince 8 and 693 are relatively prime (their GCD is 1), the answer is $m + n = 8 + 693 = 701$.",

Within each pair, the letters are arranged alphabetically, and then the six resulting \"words\" are listed in alphabetical order.\n\n# Finding the Probability\n\nFor a word containing $G$ to be the last in alphabetical order, the first letter of that word must be alphabetically later than the first letter of all other words.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1) If $G$ is the first letter in its pair, then it must be paired with a letter that comes after it alphabetically (one of $H,I,J,K,L$).\n\n2) If $G$ is the second letter in its pair, then it must be paired with a letter that comes before it alphabetically (one of $A,B,C,D,E,F$).\n\n## Case Analysis\n\nFor the word containing $G$ to be last, the first letter of that word must be the alphabetically latest first letter among all pairs.\n\nLet's examine when this can happen:\n\n- If $G$ is the first letter of its pair, for this pair to be last, all other first letters must come before $G$ alphabetically. This means the other five first letters must be chosen from $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\}$. Since there are exactly six letters before $G$, one of them must be paired with a letter that comes after it. But this isn't possible - we've already determined that all letters after $G$ must be second letters if $G$ is a first letter.\n\n- If $G$ is the second letter of its pair, its partner (one of $A,B,C,D,E,F$) must be the alphabetically latest first letter. Let's check each possibility:\n  * If $G$ is paired with $F$, then $F$ must be the alphabetically latest first letter, which means $A,B,C,D,E$ must all be first letters.\n  * For letters $A$ through $E$, this is only possible if they're all paired with letters that come after them alphabetically from the set $\\{H,I,J,K,L\\}$.\n\nThis is possible only when $G$ is paired with $F$, and the remaining pairs are formed by matching $\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$ with $\\{H,I,J,K,L\\}$.\n\n## Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability equals:\n- Probability that $G$ is paired with $F$ (which is $\\frac{1}{11}$)\n- Multiplied by the probability that, given this pairing, $F$ is the alphabetically latest first letter\n\nGiven that $G$ is paired with $F$, the remaining ten letters must be paired such that $A,B,C,D,E$ are all first letters. This requires pairing them with $H,I,J,K,L$.\n\nThe probability is $\\frac{1}{11} \\cdot \\frac{8}{63} = \\frac{8}{693}$\n\nTherefore, $m = 8$ and $n = 693$, and $m+n = 8+693 = 701$.",

        "original_response": "# The Monty Hall Problem: You Should Switch Doors\n\nYou should switch to the other unopened door to maximize your chances of winning the car.\n\n## Why Switching Works\n\nWhen you first choose a door, your probability of picking the car is 1/3. This means there's a 2/3 probability the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n\nWhen the host (who knows where the car is) opens one of those doors to reveal a donkey, he's giving you valuable information. He's effectively combining the 2/3 probability from the doors you didn't choose into the one remaining unopened door.\n\nBy switching:\n- If you initially picked the car (1/3 chance), you'll lose by switching\n- If you initially picked a donkey (2/3 chance), you'll win by switching\n\nTherefore, switching doors doubles your chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.",
